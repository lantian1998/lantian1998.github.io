        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DN42, aka Decentralized Network 42, is a large, decentralized VPN-based network. But unlike other traditional VPNs, DN42 itself doesn't provide any VPN exits, which means it doesn't allow you to bypass Internet censorships or unlock streaming services. On the contrary, the goal of DN42 is to simulate another Internet. It uses much of the technology running on modern Internet backbones (BGP, recursive DNS, etc), and is a great replica of a real network environment.</p>
<p>In the real internet, various operators use hardware routers from different manufacturers to exchange routing information with each other, such as Cisco, Juniper, Nokia, Arista, Huawei, etc. Similarly, in DN42, different participants will also choose different BGP software and hardware, with the most commonly used being <a href="https://bird.network.cz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bird</a> and <a href="https://frrouting.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FRRouting</a>, but some also use Mikrotik, Ubiquiti EdgeRouter, or even real commercial routing hardware.</p>
<p>Because everyone chooses different BGP software and hardware, and even when using the same software, they configure their internal networks in different ways, when everyone's networks are connected together, sometimes strange problems may occur, such as BGP Flapping.</p>
<h1 id="bgp-flapping-in-the-real-internet-and-dn42">BGP Flapping in the Real Internet and DN42</h1>
<p>BGP Flapping refers to a large number of path changes of the same route occurring in a short period of time, generally originating from a network repeatedly advertising and withdrawing the same route. Each time a route is advertised and/or withdrawn, this network will pass this route to all peers connected to it. These peers will calculate new best paths based on this route, and then pass the new paths to their peers, and so on.</p>
<p>In the real internet, the problem of BGP Flapping is not too significant, firstly because hardware routers purchased by various operators at great expense have sufficient computing resources to handle these route changes, or have built-in functions to suppress frequent route changes (BGP Dampening), and secondly because real operators use physical network connections, and the high cost of physical links means that except for the largest ISPs, operators that peer with each other are not too numerous, thus reducing the exponential amplification effect.</p>
<p>However, in DN42, the most commonly used Bird BGP daemon does not support BGP Dampening, which allows flapping routes to continue propagating. Even though FRRouting supports BGP Dampening, it doesn't mean everyone will enable it. At the same time, because DN42 participants use VPN connections, the cost of establishing peers is zero, so it's common for a network to connect to dozens or even hundreds of peers, and to spread flapping routes to dozens or hundreds of peers.</p>
<p>Moreover, because DN42 is an experimental network, different participants often change their network configurations from time to time. Since flapping generally switches between several valid paths and doesn't outright cause disconnection, the participant making changes may not immediately notice the problem.</p>
<p>This leads to frequent large-scale, multi-day flapping within DN42, for example:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202512/flap-example.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202512/flap-example.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202512/flap-example.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202512/flap-example.png" alt="DN42 flapping Record Chart"></picture></p>
<p>The above chart shows the number of route updates received per second by several of my DN42 nodes. You can see that around November 7th, the number of route changes received increased, stepped up again around November 12th, and didn't decrease until November 13th.</p>
<h2 id="traditional-solutions">Traditional Solutions</h2>
<p>For DN42 participants, the biggest problem caused by flapping is the consumption of CPU resources and traffic. Many participants use VPS with limited computing resources and traffic, and flapping may lead to VPS being restricted in CPU usage, limited in network speed, or even suspended by provider.</p>
<p>However, within DN42, even if flapping is known to exist, it's not always possible to find the source of the flapping problem, let alone solve the root problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can choose to manually disconnect problematic peers, which can immediately solve your CPU and traffic consumption problems, but this is only treating the symptoms, not the root cause. A peer that seems problematic to you might just be forwarding route updates from other peers. By doing this, you might need to disconnect your self from innocent peers, especially large networks connected to dozens or hundreds of peers. Moreover, as connections between different participants change, this flapping might be passed to you through other peers, which you need to disconnect again (and hopefully reconnect the former peers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can try to contact the problematic peer, but because DN42 participants are distributed worldwide, even if the other party is willing to troubleshoot immediately, it might take up to 24 hours to receive a response after they wake up/get off work. Moreover, the other party might not be the root cause of the problem, and they might need to repeat the same process to contact problematic peers, making the entire process very time-consuming.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the real internet, large operators have a 24-hour on-duty NOC (Network Operation Center) that can immediately troubleshoot problems. But obviously, hobbyist networks like DN42 don't have such things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people have proposed solutions to rate-limit port 179 of BGP. This can reduce the CPU usage of BGP daemon, but cannot reduce the total traffic consumed (and might even increase it), and will slow down the speed of exchanging a large number of routes when disconnected peers reconnect. The reason is that the BGP protocol is based on TCP. When BGP daemon receives a route update, it will immediately send the updated route to other peers through the TCP-based BGP connection. This route update message will immediately enter the OS-allocated buffer for this TCP connection. As long as the TCP connection remains connected, this message will eventually be sent. Even if the TCP connection is very slow, causing this updated route to change again, the BGP daemon cannot withdraw this instruction from the buffer. No common operating systems such as Linux/BSD/Windows provide this mechanism. Therefore, the actual number of route updates sent is still the same, just at a slower speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the rate-limiting method, it might just delay packets before handing them to the BGP daemon (generally called Traffic Shaping), or some might directly drop packets (called Traffic Policing). If packets are directly dropped, the peer needs to retransmit the packets, which causes greater traffic consumption.</li>
<li>In my opinion, it's easier and more effective to directly limiting the CPU usage of BGP daemon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="implementing-bgp-dampening-yourself-on-bird">Implementing BGP Dampening Yourself on Bird</h1>
<p>To suppress frequent route changes, BGP Dampening needs to do two things: detect routes that change frequently, and then prevent these changes from propagating to more peers by adjusting route/peer weights, thereby reducing the total amount of route changes in the entire network.</p>
<p>Although Bird completely does not support BGP Dampening and cannot implement either of the above functions alone, the step of "detecting routes that change frequently" can already be done by existing software. Another DN42 participant Kioubit developed <a href="https://github.com/Kioubit/FlapAlerted" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FlapAlerted</a>, which can peer with your own BGP daemon and then count the number of changes in each route, thereby finding routes whose changes exceeds a threshold. However, this software can only detect and cannot send these flapping network segments back to the BGP daemon, so it cannot achieve the interception effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually, FlapAlerted has a <code>mod_roaFilter</code> plugin, which can use the RPKI mechanism (to be introduced later) to filter an existing ROA record, and remove records for the flapping routes. However, this plugin is disabled by default, and you need to compile FlapAlerted yourself to use it. In addition, you need to have already <a href="https://wiki.dn42.dev/services/RPKI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">set up RPKI based on DN42 Wiki</a>, and filter all routes without corresponding RPKI records, which is a high standard to meet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Bird has supported RPKI/ROA functionality since version 2.0. The ROA function in RPKI can be used to verify whether BGP-advertised routes come from the correct ASN. For example, the route 172.22.76.184/29 that I own in DN42 should come from my ASN 4242422547. Combined with Bird's filter functionality, you can intercept incorrect routes with methods similar to the following:</p>

<p>So, to intercept routes that change frequently, we can generate fake ROA records based on the information collected by FlapAlerted, hijacking these frequently changing routes to invalid ASNs (such as AS0). This way, when routing software like Bird receives these routes, it will consider them to come from incorrect ASNs and intercept them.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Kioubit/FlapAlerted/pull/10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I submitted a PR to the FlapAlerted project</a> to enable it to generate such fake ROA records. This functionality has been included in <a href="https://github.com/Kioubit/FlapAlerted/releases/tag/v4.1.5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FlapAlerted v4.1.5</a>.</p>
<p>However, FlapAlerted only provides an API to generate ROA record files and does not support the RPKI to Router protocol used by BGP daemon, so it cannot directly connect to Bird. For this, we need to use <a href="https://github.com/bgp/stayrtr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StayRTR</a>, which can read and periodically update ROA record files of the same format from the real internet or generated by FlapAlerted, and then send them to Bird through the RPKI to Router protocol.</p>

<h2 id="installing-flapalerted">Installing FlapAlerted</h2>
<p>We first need to install FlapAlerted and connect it to our own BGP daemon, so that FlapAlerted can obtain frequently changing routes.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also choose to directly use someone else's FlapAlerted instance, such as the one I set up at <a href="https://flapalerted.lantian.pub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://flapalerted.lantian.pub</a>, or the one set up by Burble at <a href="https://flaps.collector.dn42" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://flaps.collector.dn42</a> (needs to be accessed from within DN42).</p>
<p>If you use Docker, you can refer to the following Docker compose configuration:</p>

<p>After StayRTR starts successfully, you can modify the BGP daemon configuration to connect it to StayRTR. It should be noted here that if you <a href="https://wiki.dn42.dev/services/RPKI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already enabled RPKI referring to DN42 Wiki</a>, you must store the ROA information sent by FlapAlerted in a separate ROA table and check routes based on this ROA table separately. The reason is that if a route has multiple corresponding ASNs according to ROA information, any of these ASNs can advertise this route. Since FlapAlerted only generates information to hijack routes to invalid ASN (AS0), if mixed with normal ROA information, effectively both the original ASN and AS0 can advertise this route, which fails to achieve the filtering effect.</p>

<p>Continue to the next step after confirming that Bird is properly connected to StayRTR. If your FlapAlerted has not yet detected flapping routes, the ROA information is empty, and Bird will display a <code>Cache-Error-No-Data-Available</code> error, which is normal and can be ignored.</p>
<p>When FlapAlerted detects flapping routes, you can use the <code>birdc show route table roa_flap_v4</code> command to check whether ROA information has actually been received.</p>
<h2 id="intercepting-routes-in-bird-filters">Intercepting Routes in Bird Filters</h2>
<p>With ROA information, we can add instructions to check ROA information in the filters of the corresponding protocols in Bird.</p>
<p>If you want to minimize CPU consumption, you can choose to filter out these routes at the Import Filter stage when receiving routes, but you won't be able to access these routes either. In addition, your FlapAlerted instance will also stop receiving these routes, and repeat the process of unblocking them after some time - seeing the flapping routes again - filtering them again.</p>
<p>If you just want to reduce the impact on the DN42 network, you can choose to filter them out at the Export Filter stage when sending routes, with the side effect that your peers won't be able to access these routes through you.</p>

<p>This chart shows the effect after I configured BGP Dampening in my network. Around 18:00, although flapping occurred within the DN42 network and my nodes received these route changes through multiple peers, FlapAlerted subsequently detected these flapping and blocked these routes through the above process. Therefore, although flapping continued until around 23:00, the routes sent by my network quickly declined after a brief spike, successfully suppressing flapping for my peers.</p>
<p>As you can see, BGP Dampening cannot prevent you from receiving flapping routes, but it can help you save CPU resources, or save some network traffic for you and your peers. Therefore, in addition to configuring BGP Dampening in your network, if other networks send you flapping routes, you can also suggest these networks take similar measures, thereby suppressing flapping on a larger scale and saving traffic for all DN42 participants.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DN42 全称 Decentralized Network 42（42 号去中心网络），是一个大型的 VPN 网络。但是与其它传统 VPN 不同的是，DN42 使用了大量在互联网骨干上应用的技术（例如 BGP），可以很好的模拟一个真实的网络环境。</p>
<p>在真实的互联网中，各个运营商会使用不同厂商的硬件路由器互相交换路由信息，例如思科（Cisco）、瞻博（Juniper）、诺基亚（Nokia）、Arista、华为等。类似的，在 DN42 中，不同参与者也会选择不同的 BGP 软硬件，最常用的是 <a href="https://bird.network.cz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bird</a> 和 <a href="https://frrouting.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FRRouting</a>，但也有使用 Mikrotik、Ubiquiti EdgeRouter 甚至真正的商用路由硬件。</p>
<p>由于大家选择的 BGP 软硬件不同，并且即使使用同一款软件也会用不同的方式配置内网，所以当大家的网络连接在一起，有时候就会出一些奇怪的问题，例如 BGP Flapping。</p>
<h1 id="真实互联网和-dn42-中的-bgp-flapping">真实互联网和 DN42 中的 BGP Flapping</h1>
<p>BGP Flapping 指的是同一条路由的路径在短时间内发生大量变化，一般源于一个网络反复广播、撤销广播这一条路由。每次广播或撤销路由时，这个网络会把这条路由传递给所有与它相连的 Peer，这些 Peer 会根据这条路由计算出新的最佳路径，然后把新路径传递给它们的 Peer，与此类推。</p>
<p>在真实互联网中，BGP Flapping 的问题不算太大，一是因为各个运营商斥巨资购买的硬件路由器有足够的计算资源处理这些路由变更，或者内置了抑制路由频繁变更 （BGP Dampening）的功能，二是因为真实的运营商之间使用物理网络连接，物理链路的高价使得除了最大的几家运营商以外，与每个运营商互相 Peer 的运营商不会太多，也就减少了指数放大的效果。</p>
<p>但在 DN42 中，大家最常用的 Bird BGP 软件不支持 BGP Dampening，这使得正在 Flapping 的路由能够一直传递下去。即使 FRRouting 软件支持 BGP Dampening，也不意味着所有用户都会开。同时，由于 DN42 的参与者之间使用 VPN 互联，建立 Peer 的成本为 0，因此一个网络接入几十、上百个 Peer 完全不是问题，把 Flapping 的路由扩散给几十上百个 Peer 也完全不是问题。</p>
<p>而且由于 DN42 是一个实验性网络，不同参与者会经常调整网络配置。由于 Flapping 一般是在几条有效路径之间切换，不会造成断网，所以调整配置的参与者不一定能第一时间发现问题。</p>
<p>这就导致 DN42 内经常出现大规模、持续数日的 Flapping，例如：</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202512/flap-example.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202512/flap-example.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202512/flap-example.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202512/flap-example.png" alt="DN42 Flapping 记录图表"></picture></p>
<p>上图是我的几个 DN42 节点收到的每秒路由更新的数量，可以看到在 11 月 7 日左右，收到的路由变更数量有一个提升，在 11 月 12 日左右又上了一个台阶，直到 11 月 13 日才下降。</p>
<h2 id="传统解决方案">传统解决方案</h2>
<p>对于 DN42 参与者来说，Flapping 造成的最大问题是消耗 CPU 资源以及流量。有很多参与者用的是计算资源和流量有限的 VPS，Flapping 可能导致 VPS 被限制 CPU 使用、限制网络速率甚至被停机。</p>
<p>但是，在 DN42 内，即使知道 Flapping 存在，也不一定能找到 Flapping 问题的源头，更不一定能解决根本问题：</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>你可以选择人工切断有问题的 Peer，这可以立即解决你的 CPU 和流量消耗问题，但这只是治标不治本。在你看来有问题的 Peer 有可能只是在转发其它 Peer 的路由更新。这样做很容易误伤其它 Peer，尤其是接了几十上百个 Peer 的大型网络。而且，随着不同参与者之间的连接发生变化，这个 Flapping 可能会通过其它的 Peer 传递给你，此时你需要再次切断新的 Peer（并最好把之前的 Peer 接回来）。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>你可以尝试联系有问题的 Peer，但由于 DN42 参与者分布在全世界，即使对方愿意立即排查问题，也可能需要至多 24 小时，等对方醒了/下班了才能收到回复。而且，对方不一定是问题根源，对方可能也要重复同样的过程联系有问题的 Peer，导致整个流程非常耗时。</p>
<ul>
<li>在真实互联网中，大型运营商都有一个 24 小时值班的 NOC（Network Operation Center，网络运维中心），可以立即排查问题。但 DN42 这样的爱好者网络中显然不会有这种东西。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>也有人提出过给 BGP 的 179 端口限速的方案。这样做可以降低 BGP 软件的 CPU 占用，但无法降低总共消耗的流量（甚至可能增加），并且会延长断开 Peer 重连时交换大量路由的速度。原因在于，BGP 协议是基于 TCP 的。BGP 软件收到一条路由更新时，会立即把更新的路由通过基于 TCP 的 BGP 连接发给其它 Peer。这条更新路由的消息会立即进入操作系统给这条 TCP 连接分配的缓冲区里。只要 TCP 一直保持连接，那么这条消息迟早会发送出去。即使 TCP 连接非常缓慢，导致这条更新的路由再次发生变更，BGP 软件也无法从缓冲区中撤销这条指令，常见的 Linux/BSD/Windows 等操作系统均不提供相应的机制。因此，最终实际发送的路由更新数量还是一样的，只不过速度更慢。</p>
<ul>
<li>根据限速方式不同，有可能只是把数据包延迟之后交给 BGP 软件（一般称为 Traffic Shaping），也有些是直接丢包（称为 Traffic Policing）。如果是直接丢包，对端则需要重传数据包，反而造成了更大的流量消耗。</li>
<li>我认为，这样做还不如直接限制 BGP 软件的 CPU 占用更有效。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="在-bird-上自己实现-bgp-dampening">在 Bird 上自己实现 BGP Dampening</h1>
<p>BGP Dampening 为了抑制路由频繁变更，要做的事有两件：检测频繁发生变更的路由，然后通过调整路由/Peer 权重等方式，不让这些变更传播给更多的 Peer，从而减少整个网络中的路由变更总量。</p>
<p>尽管 Bird 完全不支持 BGP Dampening，也无法单独实现上述任一功能，但「检测频繁发生变更的路由」这一步已经有现有的软件可以做了。另一名 DN42 参与者 Kioubit 开发了 <a href="https://github.com/Kioubit/FlapAlerted" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FlapAlerted</a> 这款软件，可以 Peer 上你自己的 BGP 软件，然后统计各条路由变化的次数，从而找出路由变化量超过阈值的路由。但这款软件只能检测，无法方便地把这些发生 Flapping 的网段发回给 BGP 软件，因此无法实现拦截的效果。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>实际上 FlapAlerted 有一个 <code>mod_roaFilter</code> 插件，可以利用稍后会介绍的 RPKI 功能，过滤一份现有的 ROA 记录，删除 Flapping 网段的记录。但这个功能默认禁用，需要手动编译 FlapAlerted 开启这个插件。而且你需要已经<a href="https://wiki.dn42.dev/services/RPKI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">参照 DN42 Wiki 开启了 RPKI</a>，并且过滤所有没有对应 RPKI 记录的路由，门槛比较高。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>不过，Bird 自 2.0 版本开始支持了 RPKI/ROA 功能。RPKI 中的 ROA 功能可以用来验证 BGP 广播的路由是否来自正确的 ASN。例如，我在 DN42 中拥有的 172.22.76.184/29 这段路由应该来自我的 ASN 4242422547。再配合上 Bird 的过滤器功能，就可以用类似下面的方法拦截错误的路由：</p>

<p>那么，为了拦截频繁发生变更的路由，我们可以基于 FlapAlerted 收集到的信息，生成虚假的 ROA 记录，把这些频繁变更的路由劫持到无效的 ASN 上（例如 AS0）。这样 Bird 等路由软件收到这些路由时，就会认为它们来自错误的 ASN，并拦截它们。</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Kioubit/FlapAlerted/pull/10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">我向 FlapAlerted 项目提交了一个 PR</a>，让它能够生成这样的虚假 ROA 记录。这个功能已经包含在 <a href="https://github.com/Kioubit/FlapAlerted/releases/tag/v4.1.5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FlapAlerted v4.1.5</a> 版本中。</p>
<p>不过，FlapAlerted 只是提供了一个生成 ROA 记录文件的 API，它并不支持 BGP 软件使用的 RPKI to Router 协议，因此无法直接连接到 Bird 上。为此，我们需要用到 <a href="https://github.com/bgp/stayrtr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StayRTR</a> 软件，它可以读取并定时更新真实互联网中的，或者 FlapAlerted 生成的相同格式的 ROA 记录文件，然后将它们通过 RPKI to Router 协议发送给 Bird。</p>

<p>当然，你也可以选择直接使用别人搭建好的 FlapAlerted，例如我搭建的 <a href="https://flapalerted.lantian.pub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://flapalerted.lantian.pub</a>，或者 Burble 搭建的 <a href="https://flaps.collector.dn42" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://flaps.collector.dn42</a>（需要从 DN42 内部访问）。</p>
<p>如果你使用 Docker，可以参考下面的 Docker compose 配置：</p>

<p>在 StayRTR 启动成功后，你就可以修改 BGP 软件的配置，让它连接到 StayRTR。这里需要注意的是，如果你<a href="https://wiki.dn42.dev/services/RPKI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">原本就参考 DN42 Wiki 启用了 RPKI</a>，则必须把 FlapAlerted 发来的 ROA 信息单独存在一张 ROA 表里面，并单独基于这个 ROA 表检查一次路由。这样做的原因是，如果 ROA 信息中一条路由有多条对应的 ASN，那么这些 ASN 中的任何一个都可以广播这条路由。由于 FlapAlerted 只是生成了将路由劫持到无效 ASN（AS0）的信息，如果和正常的 ROA 信息混在一起，效果就是原本的 ASN 和 AS0 都可以广播这条路由，就起不到过滤效果了。</p>

<p>这张图展示了我在我的网络配置完 BGP Dampening 之后的效果。在 18 时左右，尽管 DN42 网络内部发生了 Flapping，并且我的节点通过多个 Peer 接收到了这些路由变更，但 FlapAlerted 随后检测到了这些 Flapping 并通过上面的流程屏蔽了这些路由。因此，尽管 Flapping 持续到了 23 时左右，但我的网络发送的路由在短暂的尖峰后就迅速下降，成功地为我的 Peer 抑制了 Flapping。</p>
<p>可以看到，BGP Dampening 无法阻止你收到 Flapping 路由，但可以帮你节省 CPU 资源，或者为你和你的 Peer 节省部分网络流量。因此，除了在你的网络配置 BGP Dampening 之外，如果其它网络向你发送 Flapping 路由，你也可以建议这些网络采取类似的措施，从而在更大的范围抑制 Flapping，为所有 DN42 的参与者节省流量。</p>

        <updated>2025-07-20T12:38:31.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://lantian.pub/en/article/modify-computer/legal-lte-network-at-home-for-100-bucks.lantian/">previous post</a>, I built a legal LTE network using the US CBRS band and <a href="https://magmacore.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Magma LTE core network software</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding "legal": I am not a lawyer or a wireless expert. Based on my research into the relevant policies and regulations, my entire setup should be legal. However, I take no responsibility if you encounter any legal issues after following the instructions in this post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I chose Magma at the time because the CBRS LTE base station I bought was originally used for the Helium Mobile network, and <a href="https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0139-phase-out-cbrs.md#what-to-do-with-cbrs-radios" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nova Labs/Helium Mobile uses Magma for its CBRS core network</a>. This ensured that Magma was compatible with my base station. However, from the perspective of building a self-hosted core network in a Homelab, Magma has these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magma's core network relies on Docker or Kubernetes for deployment, making it difficult to deploy outside of containers using conventional methods (e.g., systemd services). As a NixOS user, I prefer to avoid bloated Docker containers and manage services on the system using systemd.</li>
<li>Magma's Access Gateway can only be installed on Ubuntu 20.04, which has a completely different system management approach from my usual NixOS. This means I would need to manually manage the Access Gateway machine's configuration and system upgrades, without being able to reuse my existing NixOS configuration.</li>
<li>Magma sometimes has strange issues, such as:
<ul>
<li>Android phones always failing to connect to the base station while iPhones work fine;</li>
<li>Phones unable to properly obtain the network name, always displaying MCC/MNC <code>315 010</code> instead of the actual configured network name <code>Lan Tian Mobile</code>;</li>
<li>The Access Gateway connected to the core network and synchronized configurations normally, but the core network management interface showed that the Access Gateway had not been connected for a long time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, after finishing the previous post and confirming the feasibility of building a self-hosted LTE network, I began trying to replace Magma with another open-source LTE core network software, <a href="https://open5gs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open5GS</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to Magma, Open5GS has these advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open5GS does not distinguish between core network and Access Gateway components; it can be fully deployed on a single machine.</li>
<li>Open5GS packages are already available in Nixpkgs (<code>pkgs.open5gs</code>), so I can install and use it directly on NixOS without needing to package it myself, and without Docker or Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Open5GS does not have the strange issues that Magma has; once set up, it is quite stable.</li>
</ul>
<p>This post documents the process of setting up a core network with Open5GS on NixOS, and connecting a FreedomFi/Sercomm SCE4255W base station to the core network to transmit LTE signals.</p>
<h1 id="installing-open5gs">Installing Open5GS</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I referenced the following materials during the configuration process:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open5GS official documentation</a></li>
<li>A set of Open5GS (and some add-ons) configurations packaged as ready-to-use Docker containers: <a href="https://github.com/herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>This post assumes you have prepared the following hardware or software configurations as described in my <a href="https://lantian.pub/en/article/modify-computer/legal-lte-network-at-home-for-100-bucks.lantian/">previous post</a>. If you have not completed these configurations, you can refer to the corresponding sections in the previous post to configure the software or purchase the hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>A FreedomFi/Sercomm SCE4255W base station with the web management interface unlocked.</li>
<li>The base station is already registered with the CBRS SAS.</li>
<li>A SIM card programmedwith authentication information (KI, OPC, etc.), and you have recorded this authentication information (for later registration with Open5GS).</li>
</ul>
<p>This post will use NixOS for all configurations, but I also provides some commands for Ubuntu, which users of other Linux distributions can use as a reference.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-open5gs-components">Understanding Open5GS Components</h2>
<p>Open5GS, as its name suggests, is primarily a software that implements a 5G core network (as well as a LTE core network). Since the core network protocols and structure in the 5G era are significantly different from the 4G era, especially for standalone 5G SA networks, Open5GS can roughly be seen as a set of LTE/5G NSA core network software, plus a set of 5G SA core network software, with a small portion of components shared between them.</p>
<p>The LTE/5G NSA part of Open5GS consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>MME - Mobility Management Entity</li>
<li>HSS - Home Subscriber Server</li>
<li>PCRF - Policy and Charging Rules Function</li>
<li>SGWC - Serving Gateway Control Plane</li>
<li>SGWU - Serving Gateway User Plane</li>
<li>SMF - Session Management Function
<ul>
<li>SMF itself is a 5G core network component, but Open5GS SMF also implements the Packet Gateway Control Plane in the 4G core network structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UPF - User Plane Function
<ul>
<li>UPF itself is a 5G core network component, but Open5GS UPF also implements the Packet Gateway User Plane in the 4G core network structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SCP - <del>Secure, Contain, Protect</del> Service Communication Proxy
<ul>
<li>SCP itself is a 5G core network component, but SMF depends on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NRF - NF Repository Function
<ul>
<li>NRF itself is a 5G core network component, but SCP depends on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the 5G SA part consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>NRF - NF Repository Function</li>
<li>SCP - Service Communication Proxy</li>
<li>SEPP - Security Edge Protection Proxy</li>
<li>AMF - Access and Mobility Management Function</li>
<li>SMF - Session Management Function</li>
<li>UPF - User Plane Function</li>
<li>AUSF - Authentication Server Function</li>
<li>UDM - Unified Data Management</li>
<li>UDR - Unified Data Repository</li>
<li>PCF - Policy and Charging Function</li>
<li>NSSF - Network Slice Selection Function</li>
<li>BSF - Binding Support Function</li>
</ul>
<p>These components communicate with each other in the following structure:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/Open5GS_CUPS-01.jpg.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/Open5GS_CUPS-01.jpg.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/Open5GS_CUPS-01.jpg.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202507/Open5GS_CUPS-01.jpg" alt="Open5GS Component Architecture Diagram"></picture></p>
<p>(Image source: <a href="https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/01-quickstart/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open5GS official documentation</a>)</p>
<p>The communication between various components of the 4G/5G core network uses the standardized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter_(protocol)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Diameter protocol</a>, which is based on TCP or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SCTP</a> protocol, exchanging data between various components of the 4G/5G core network. This also means that hardware and software from different vendors, as long as they support the Diameter protocol, can join the same core network and jointly provide services to mobile users.</p>
<p>However, in this post, I will only use Open5GS components, and will not add other components to the core network for now.</p>

<p>During this process, in addition to installing the Open5GS binaries, a set of systemd services corresponding to each Open5GS component is created, and the default Open5GS configuration is copied to <code>/etc</code>.</p>
<p>Since NixOS only has the Open5GS package (<code>pkgs.open5gs</code>) and no corresponding NixOS module, we need to manually create systemd services for Open5GS, mimicking the installation process on other systems like Ubuntu:</p>

<h2 id="creating-open5gs-configuration-files">Creating Open5GS Configuration Files</h2>
<p>If you are using Ubuntu, the above installation process should have automatically installed the default configuration files to <code>/etc/freeDiameter</code> and <code>/etc/open5gs</code>. However, in NixOS, this process is not automatic, and we need to manually copy the configuration files or manually specify their paths.</p>
<p>Since the Nixpkgs Open5GS package already comes with a set of default configurations, we can directly copy the default configuration files from this package. First, build the package:</p>

<p>If all goes well, Nix will download the pre-compiled Open5GS from the Binary Cache and symlink it to the <code>result</code> directory. At this point, we can see the default configuration files in the <code>result/etc</code> folder:</p>

<p>Once the Open5GS package or its dependencies are updated, the path of Open5GS in the Nix store will change, causing files specified by absolute paths to become invalid, and preventing Open5GS from starting. Therefore, we need to keep these paths synchronized with the Open5GS path, or point them outside the Nix store, to prevent future issues.</p>

<h2 id="optional-regenerate-diameter-tls-certificates">(Optional) Regenerate Diameter TLS Certificates</h2>
<p>Open5GS packaged in Nixpkgs comes with a TLS certificate generated during the build process. If your Open5GS is downloaded from the Binary Cache instead of being compiled locally, you will be using the same TLS key  others can download from the Binary Cache.</p>
<p>If you deploy on a single machine according to this tutorial, since all communication is local and does not go through external networks, encryption and private key leakage have little impact on security.</p>
<p>However, if you plan to place some components on other machines, or if you do not want to use this leaked key, you can generate a new one using the following script:</p>

<h1 id="connecting-freedomfisercomm-base-station-to-open5gs">Connecting FreedomFi/Sercomm Base Station to Open5GS</h1>
<p>First, please ensure that you can log in to the FreedomFi/Sercomm SCE4255 base station's web management panel via IP address. If you cannot access the base station's web management panel, please refer to the <a href="https://lantian.pub/en/article/modify-computer/legal-lte-network-at-home-for-100-bucks.lantian/#unlocking-the-management-interface-of-the-indoor-base-station">section on enabling the management panel in my previous post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="disabling-tr-069-remote-management">Disabling TR-069 Remote Management</h2>
<p>FreedomFi's Sercomm base stations by default connect to <code>acs.freedomfi.com</code>, a TR-069 server, to automatically obtain configurations. Although this remote management server was shut down when Helium Mobile discontinued its CBRS network, our base station will still continuously try to connect to this server. When using Magma to build the core network, since the Magma core network itself has TR-069 server functionality, we can keep remote management enabled and simply hijack remote management requests to our TR-069 server. However, Open5GS does not have TR-069 functionality, so we need to disable the base station's TR-069 remote management to avoid unnecessary requests, and prevent the base station's configuration from being accidentally overwritten.</p>
<p>Click <code>TR098</code> at the top of the management interface, then switch to the <code>MgntServer</code> tab to switch to the base station's TR-069 remote management settings page:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-tr069.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-tr069.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-tr069.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-tr069.png" alt="Sercomm Base Station TR-069 Settings Page"></picture></p>
<p>Uncheck <code>EnableCWMP</code>, then click the <code>Save</code> button to save the settings.</p>
<p>Since the Sercomm base station management panel has some bugs, it is recommended to restart the base station here to ensure the settings take effect. The base station may automatically restart when saving settings, but if it does not, you can manually restart it by clicking the power button in the upper right corner of the management interface, or by manually power cycling it. After restarting, please return to this page and ensure <code>EnableCWMP</code> is unchecked.</p>
<p>At this point, the base station's TR-069 remote management function is disabled, and we can modify settings without fear of being overwritten by remote management.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-base-station-cbrs-sas-connection-configuration">Modifying Base Station CBRS SAS Connection Configuration</h2>
<p>The next step is to connect the base station to the CBRS SAS server to obtain spectrum allocation, thereby avoiding conflicts with other base stations or operator signals, and preventing the FCC from SWATting you. When using the Magma core network, the CBRS SAS connection is automatically configured by Magma's TR-069 server, but since Open5GS does not have TR-069 functionality, this needs to be done manually.</p>
<p>First, ensure your base station is registered with the SAS. You can refer to the <a href="https://lantian.pub/en/article/modify-computer/legal-lte-network-at-home-for-100-bucks.lantian/#connecting-the-base-station-to-sas">section on connecting to SAS in my previous post</a>.</p>
<p>Then, click <code>Manage</code> at the top of the base station management interface, then switch to the <code>SAS Configuration</code> tab:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas.png" alt="Sercomm Base Station SAS Settings Page"></picture></p>
<ul>
<li>Check the <code>Enable</code> option.</li>
<li>Enter <code>0</code> for the <code>Method</code> option.</li>
<li>Select <code>Commercial-Google</code> for <code>Server</code>, corresponding to Google SAS. At this point, <code>Server Url</code> should be automatically populated.</li>
<li>Enter your Google Cloud Project ID for <code>UserID</code>, which can be found on the console homepage: <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://console.cloud.google.com</a></li>
<li>Select <code>A</code> for <code>Category</code>, corresponding to indoor base stations.</li>
<li>Select <code>GAA</code> for <code>ChannelType</code>, corresponding to the lowest priority of the three types of CBRS users.</li>
<li>Enter <code>/C=TW/O=Sercomm/OU=WInnForum CBSD Certificate/CN=P27-SCE4255W:%s</code> for <code>CertSubject</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas-location.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas-location.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas-location.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas-location.png" alt="Sercomm Base Station SAS Location Settings Page"></picture></p>
<ul>
<li>Select <code>indoor</code> for <code>Location</code>, corresponding to indoor deployment.</li>
<li>If your base station's location has good GPS signal, <code>Location Source</code> can be set to <code>GPS</code>. However, if the GPS signal is poor, the base station will need to wait for GPS positioning to complete before connecting to CBRS SAS and starting to transmit signals after restarting. In this case, you can select <code>Manual</code> and manually enter the base station's latitude and longitude.</li>
<li><code>Latitude</code> is latitude, with positive values for north of equator, and negative values for south of equator. Note that the unit for Sercomm base station's latitude and longitude is microdegrees (i.e., one millionth of a degree), so if you want to set 40 degrees north of equator, please enter <code>40000000</code>.</li>
<li><code>Longitude</code> is longitude, with positive values for east of meridian, and negative values for west of meridian. Note that the unit for Sercomm base station's latitude and longitude is microdegrees (i.e., one millionth of a degree), so if you want to set 80 degrees west of meridian, please enter <code>-80000000</code>.
<ul>
<li>Please obtain the latitude and longitude using your mobile phone or other devices for actual positioning. The base station's location needs to be relatively precise, otherwise it will affect the CBRS SAS spectrum allocation. This latitude and longitude should also be consistent with the latitude and longitude set on the CBRS SAS platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select <code>AMSL</code> for <code>HeightType</code>, which means height above mean sea level.</li>
<li>Enter the base station's altitude for <code>Elevation</code>, in millimeters, so if you want to set 40 meters above sea level, please enter <code>40000</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Save the settings. You don't need to restart the base station yet; you can wait until configuring the base station's connection to the Open5GS core network in the next step.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-base-station-core-network-connection-configuration">Modifying Base Station Core Network Connection Configuration</h2>
<p>The next step is to connect the base station to the Open5GS core network to transmit user information and data traffic.</p>
<p>Click <code>Manage</code> at the top of the base station management interface, then switch to the <code>LTE Basic Setting</code> tab:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas-location.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas-location.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas-location.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-sas-location.png" alt="Sercomm Base Station LTE Settings Page"></picture></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Under <code>Cell Configuration</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the <code>AdminStats</code> option, which means enabling signal transmission.</li>
<li>Select <code>1</code> for <code>Carrier Number</code>.
<ul>
<li>If you select <code>2</code> and adjust the settings below accordingly, you can enable carrier aggregation to double the bandwidth, but Sercomm's CBRS SAS implementation has some issues that may randomly cause signal transmission interruptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not check the <code>Carrier Aggregation</code> option.
<ul>
<li>If you want to enable carrier aggregation, check this box.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select <code>20</code> for <code>BandWidth</code> to maximize bandwidth for highest speed.</li>
<li>Enter <code>0</code> for <code>CellIDentity</code>. If you have multiple base stations, you can enter <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, etc., sequentially, ensuring no duplication between base stations.
<ul>
<li>If you want to enable carrier aggregation, enter <code>0,1</code>, which means two different IDs separated by a comma.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enter <code>100</code> for <code>PCI</code>. If you have multiple base stations, you can enter <code>101</code>, <code>102</code>, etc., sequentially, ensuring no duplication between base stations.
<ul>
<li>If you want to enable carrier aggregation, enter <code>100,101</code>, which means two different IDs separated by a comma.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enter <code>24</code> for <code>TxPower</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under <code>S1 Configuration</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select IPv4 for <code>Tunnel Type</code>. At this point, data between the base station and the core network is transmitted in plain text.
<ul>
<li>Since our base station and core network are on the same local area network and are physically controlled by us, the security risk here is small. However, if your base station needs to connect to the core network over Internet, you should try using the <code>IPSEC</code> option, but you will need to additionally configure IPSec tunnel related settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enter the IP address of the <code>Open5GS</code> core network machine for <code>MME IP Address</code>.
<ul>
<li>If different components of your <code>Open5GS</code> core network are installed on different machines, enter the IP address of the machine running the MME component here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enter <code>315010</code> for <code>PLMNID</code>, corresponding to CBRS's MCC/MNC.</li>
<li>Enter <code>1</code> for <code>TAC</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your base station's location has good GPS signal, <code>Sync Source</code> can be set to <code>GPS</code>. However, if the GPS signal is poor, the base station will need to wait for GPS positioning to complete before starting to transmit signals after restarting. In this case, you can select <code>FREE_RUNNING</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Save the settings. It is recommended to restart the base station once here to ensure the settings take effect. The base station may automatically restart when saving settings, but if it does not, you can manually restart it by clicking the power button in the upper right corner of the management interface, or by manually power cycling it.</p>
<p>After restarting, wait a moment and check the base station's indicator lights; the leftmost LTE status indicator light should be a steady blue, indicating that it's now transmitting LTE signals. This completes the base station configuration.</p>
<p>Take out your phone, select any SIM card, turn off the "Automatic Network Selection" option, and the phone will automatically search for nearby mobile networks. If your phone supports LTE band 48,  you should see a network named <code>Lan Tian Mobile</code> (or your own configured network name), which is the signal transmitted by your base station.</p>
<p>The base station management panel should also display <code>henb running</code>, indicating that the base station is running normally:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-status.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-status.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-status.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-status.png" alt="Sercomm Base Station Status Page"></picture></p>
<h1 id="registering-sim-card-information-with-open5gs">Registering SIM Card Information with Open5GS</h1>
<p>After the core network and base station are running normally, you can register SIM cards with the core network to allow phones and other devices using these SIM cards to connect to the LTE network.</p>
<p>Prepare a few programmable SIM cards and program authentication information to your SIM cards according to the <a href="https://lantian.pub/en/article/modify-computer/legal-lte-network-at-home-for-100-bucks.lantian/#programming-sim-cards">SIM card programming tutorial in the previous post</a>. Record the SIM card's IMSI/KI/OPC information.</p>
<p>Log in to Open5GS's web management panel, then click <code>Add a subscriber</code>:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/open5gs-add-subscriber.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/open5gs-add-subscriber.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/open5gs-add-subscriber.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202507/open5gs-add-subscriber.png" alt="Open5GS Add SIM Card Interface"></picture></p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the SIM card's corresponding IMSI information for <code>IMSI</code>.</li>
<li>Enter the SIM card's <code>KI</code> for <code>Subscriber Key</code>.</li>
<li>Enter the SIM card's <code>OPC</code> for <code>Operator Key</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep all other options at their defaults and click Save.</p>
<p>Insert the SIM card into your phone, wait a moment, and your phone should be able to connect to your mobile network.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>This post mainly records the steps that differ from the Magma core network when setting up Open5GS, as well as some issues specific to setting it up on NixOS. Compared to Magma, Open5GS has a simpler installation process and does not rely on containerization management tools like Docker. If you are using Ubuntu, most of the above process is actually automatically completed during <code>apt install</code>.</p>
<p>From the perspective of LTE terminal devices (e.g., mobile phones), there is no difference in using these two core network software. Both have similar latency and network bandwidth, mainly limited by LTE communication itself. (Except for the strange bug I encountered with Magma where Android phones could not authenticate properly.)</p>
<p>I switched to Open5GS for the management convenience mentioned at the beginning. You can choose either Open5GS or Magma based on your preference.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2025-07-20T12:38:31.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lantian.pub/article/modify-computer/legal-lte-network-at-home-for-100-bucks.lantian/">在上一篇文章中</a>，我用美国的 CBRS 频段和 <a href="https://magmacore.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Magma LTE 核心网软件</a>搭建了一套合法的 LTE 网络。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>关于「合法」：我不是律师或者无线电专家。根据我对相关政策法规的研究，我的整套配置应当是合法的。但如果你按照本文操作后遇到了法律问题，我不负任何责任。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>我当时选择 Magma，是因为我买的 CBRS LTE 基站原本用于 Helium Mobile 网络，而 <a href="https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0139-phase-out-cbrs.md#what-to-do-with-cbrs-radios" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nova Labs/Helium Mobile 使用的 CBRS 核心网就是 Magma</a>。这保证了 Magma 一定兼容我手上的基站。但是，从在 Homelab 里自建核心网的角度来考虑，Magma 存在这些问题：</p>
<ul>
<li>Magma 的核心网依赖 Docker 或者 Kubernetes 进行部署，难以用常规的方式（例如 systemd 服务）在容器外部署。而我是 NixOS 用户，希望尽量避免臃肿的 Docker 容器，而是用 systemd 服务管理系统上的服务。</li>
<li>Magma 的访问网关（Access Gateway）只能安装在 Ubuntu 20.04 系统上，系统管理方式与我常用的 NixOS 完全不同。这意味着我需要手工管理访问网关机器的配置以及系统升级，无法复用我现有的 NixOS 配置。</li>
<li>Magma 有时会出一些奇怪的问题，例如：
<ul>
<li>Android 手机死活连不上基站但 iPhone 没问题；</li>
<li>手机无法正常获取网络名称，网络名称总是显示为 MCC/MNC <code>315 010</code> 而不是我配置的网络名 <code>Lan Tian Mobile</code>；</li>
<li>访问网关明明连上了核心网并且正常同步配置，但核心网管理界面中显示访问网关已经很久没连上了。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>因此，在上一篇文章完成，确定自建 LTE 网络可行后，我就开始尝试用另一款开源 LTE 核心网软件 <a href="https://open5gs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open5GS</a> 替换 Magma。</p>
<p>相比 Magma，Open5GS 有这些优点：</p>
<ul>
<li>Open5GS 不区分核心网和访问网关两套组件，只需要一台机器就可以完整部署。</li>
<li>Nixpkgs 中已经有了 Open5GS 软件包（<code>pkgs.open5gs</code>），我不用自己打包就能直接在 NixOS 上安装使用，不需要 Docker 或者 Ubuntu。</li>
<li>Open5GS 没有 Magma 那些奇怪的问题，一旦搭建完成就可以稳定运行。</li>
</ul>
<p>本文记录我在 NixOS 系统上用 Open5GS 搭建核心网，并且用 FreedomFi/Sercomm 的 SCE4255W 基站连接核心网、发射 LTE 信号的过程。</p>
<h1 id="安装-open5gs">安装 Open5GS</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>配置过程参考了以下资料：</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open5GS 的官方文档</a></li>
<li>一套打包成开箱即用 Docker 容器的 Open5GS（以及一些附加组件）配置：<a href="https://github.com/herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="准备工作">准备工作</h2>
<p>本文假定你已经按照我的<a href="https://lantian.pub/article/modify-computer/legal-lte-network-at-home-for-100-bucks.lantian/">上一篇文章</a>准备好了这些硬件或软件配置。如果你没有完成这些配置，可以参考上一篇文章中的对应教程配置软件或者购买硬件：</p>
<ul>
<li>一台 FreedomFi/Sercomm 的 SCE4255W 基站，已经解锁 Web 管理界面</li>
<li>基站已经注册到 CBRS SAS 上</li>
<li>一张已经写好认证信息（KI，OPC 等值）的 SIM 卡，并且你记录了这些认证信息（以便稍后注册到 Open5GS）</li>
</ul>
<p>本文基于 NixOS 进行所有配置，但也提供了一些 Ubuntu 相关的命令，以便其它 Linux 发行版的用户参考。</p>
<h2 id="了解-open5gs-的组件">了解 Open5GS 的组件</h2>
<p>Open5GS 如其名，是一套主要实现 5G 核心网（但也实现了 LTE 核心网）的软件。由于 5G 时代的核心网协议和结构与 4G 时代相比有了较大不同，尤其是独立组网的 5G SA 网络，因此 Open5GS 大致上可以看作是一套 LTE/5G NSA 核心网软件，加上一套 5G SA 核心网软件，两者之间共享一小部分组件。</p>
<p>Open5GS 的 LTE/5G NSA 部分由如下组件组成：</p>
<ul>
<li>MME - Mobility Management Entity</li>
<li>HSS - Home Subscriber Server</li>
<li>PCRF - Policy and Charging Rules Function</li>
<li>SGWC - Serving Gateway Control Plane</li>
<li>SGWU - Serving Gateway User Plane</li>
<li>SMF - Session Management Function
<ul>
<li>SMF 本身是 5G 核心网的组件，但 Open5GS SMF 也实现了 4G 核心网结构中的 Packet Gateway Control Plane</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UPF - User Plane Function
<ul>
<li>UPF 本身是 5G 核心网的组件，但 Open5GS UPF 也实现了 4G 核心网结构中的 Packet Gateway User Plane</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NRF - NF Repository Function
<ul>
<li>NRF 本身是 5G 核心网的组件，但是 SCP 依赖它</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SCP - <del>Secure, Contain, Protect</del> Service Communication Proxy
<ul>
<li>SCP 本身是 5G 核心网的组件，但是 SMF 依赖它</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>而 5G SA 部分由如下组件组成：</p>
<ul>
<li>NRF - NF Repository Function</li>
<li>SCP - Service Communication Proxy</li>
<li>SEPP - Security Edge Protection Proxy</li>
<li>AMF - Access and Mobility Management Function</li>
<li>SMF - Session Management Function</li>
<li>UPF - User Plane Function</li>
<li>AUSF - Authentication Server Function</li>
<li>UDM - Unified Data Management</li>
<li>UDR - Unified Data Repository</li>
<li>PCF - Policy and Charging Function</li>
<li>NSSF - Network Slice Selection Function</li>
<li>BSF - Binding Support Function</li>
</ul>
<p>这些组件之间以如下的结构互相通信：</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/Open5GS_CUPS-01.jpg.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/Open5GS_CUPS-01.jpg.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/Open5GS_CUPS-01.jpg.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202507/Open5GS_CUPS-01.jpg" alt="Open5GS 组件结构图"></picture></p>
<p>（图源：<a href="https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/01-quickstart/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open5GS 官方文档</a>）</p>
<p>4G/5G 核心网的各个组件之间通信走的是标准化的 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter_(protocol)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Diameter 协议</a>，它基于 TCP 或者 <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B5%81%E6%8E%A7%E5%88%B6%E4%BC%A0%E8%BE%93%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SCTP</a> 协议，在 4G/5G 核心网的各个组件之间交换数据。这也意味着来自不同厂商的软硬件，只要支持 Diameter 协议，就都可以加入同一个核心网中，共同为移动用户提供服务。</p>
<p>但本文中我将全程使用 Open5GS 的组件，暂时不将别的组件加入核心网。</p>

<h2 id="创建-open5gs-配置文件">创建 Open5GS 配置文件</h2>
<p>如果你用的是 Ubuntu，上面的安装过程应该已经自动将默认配置文件安装到了 <code>/etc/freeDiameter</code> 和 <code>/etc/open5gs</code> 下。但在 NixOS 中，这个过程不会自动完成，我们需要手动复制配置文件，或者手动指定配置文件的路径。</p>
<p>由于 Nixpkgs 的 Open5GS 软件包已经自带了一组默认配置，我们可以直接从这个包里复制默认配置文件。首先构建软件包：</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">nix</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> build</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> nixpkgs#open5gs</span></span></code></pre>
<p>不出意外，Nix 会从 Binary Cache 里下载预先编译好的 Open5GS，并且把它软链接到 <code>result</code> 目录下。此时我们在 <code>result/etc</code> 文件夹下就可以看到默认的配置文件了：</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">ls</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> result/etc</span></span></code></pre>
<p>然后我们就可以把它们复制到自己的 NixOS 配置中，以便后续修改：</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">cp</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#569CD6;--shiki-light:#0000FF"> -r</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> result/etc/freeDiameter</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> /path/to/your/nixos-config/freeDiameter</span></span>

<h2 id="修复-nixos-下-open5gs-配置文件中的路径">修复 NixOS 下 Open5GS 配置文件中的路径</h2>

<p>首先获取 Open5GS 的实际安装路径：</p>

<p>直接全局搜索 <code>mcc: 999</code> 和 <code>mnc: 70</code>，然后将它们替换成 <code>mcc: 315</code> 和 <code>mnc: 010</code> 即可：</p>

<p>FreedomFi 出售的 Sercomm 基站默认会连接 <code>acs.freedomfi.com</code> 这个 TR-069 服务器，从 TR-069 服务器自动获取配置。虽然这个远程管理服务器随着 Helium Mobile 停用 CBRS 网络而关闭，但我们的基站仍然会不停尝试连接远程管理。在用 Magma 搭建核心网时，由于 Magma 核心网自带 TR-069 服务器的功能，所以我们可以保持远程管理开启，只需要将远程管理劫持到我们的 TR-069 服务器即可。但 Open5GS 没有 TR-069 的功能，所以我们要关闭基站的 TR-069 远程管理，避免不必要的请求，并防止基站的配置被意外覆盖。</p>
<p>在管理界面的顶部点击 <code>TR098</code>，然后点击 <code>MgntServer</code> 标签页，切换到基站的 TR-069 远程管理设置页面：</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-tr069.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-tr069.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-tr069.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-tr069.png" alt="Sercomm 基站的 TR-069 设置页面"></picture></p>
<p>取消勾选 <code>EnableCWMP</code>，然后点击 <code>Save</code> 按钮保存设置。</p>
<p>由于 Sercomm 基站管理面板的 Bug 有点多，所以这里建议重启一次基站以保证设置生效。保存设置时基站可能会自动重启，但如果基站没有重启，可以点击管理界面右上角的电源按钮手动重启一次，或者手动断电重启。重启完后请再次回到此页面并保证 <code>EnableCWMP</code> 是关闭状态。</p>
<p>此时，基站的 TR-069 远程管理功能就关闭了，我们就可以随意修改设置，不怕被远程管理覆盖了。</p>
<h2 id="修改基站的-cbrs-sas-连接配置">修改基站的 CBRS SAS 连接配置</h2>
<p>下一步是让基站连接 CBRS SAS 服务器，获取频段分配，从而避免和其它基站或者运营商的信号发生冲突，以及避免 FCC 上门和你玩彩虹六号。在使用 Magma 核心网时，CBRS SAS 的连接配置由 Magma 的 TR-069 服务器自动下发，但由于 Open5GS 没有 TR-069 的功能，这部分就需要我们手动设置了。</p>
<p>首先确保你的基站已经注册到了 SAS 上，可以参考<a href="https://lantian.pub/article/modify-computer/legal-lte-network-at-home-for-100-bucks.lantian/#%E5%9F%BA%E7%AB%99%E8%BF%9E%E6%8E%A5-sas">我的上一篇文章中，连接 SAS 的部分</a>。</p>
<p>然后，在基站管理界面的顶部点击 <code>Manage</code>，然后点击 <code>SAS Configuration</code> 标签页：</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Location</code> 选择 <code>indoor</code>，对应室内部署。</li>
<li>如果你的基站所在位置 GPS 信号良好，<code>Location Source</code> 可以选择 <code>GPS</code>。但如果 GPS 信号差，基站重启后需要等待 GPS 定位完成后才会连接 CBRS SAS 并开始发送信号。此时你可以选择 <code>Manual</code> 并手动输入基站的经纬度。</li>
<li><code>Latitude</code> 是纬度，正数为北纬，负数为南纬。注意 Sercomm 基站的经纬度单位是微度（即百万分之一度），所以如果你要设置北纬 40 度，请输入 <code>40000000</code>.</li>
<li><code>Longitude</code> 是经度，正数为东经，负数为西经。注意 Sercomm 基站的经纬度单位是微度（即百万分之一度），所以如果你要设置西经 80 度，请输入 <code>-80000000</code>.
<ul>
<li>经纬度请用你的手机等设备实际定位得到，基站的位置需要比较精确，否则会影响到 CBRS SAS 的频段分配。同时这个经纬度应该和 CBRS SAS 平台上设置的经纬度一致。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>HeightType</code> 选择 <code>AMSL</code>，即相对海平面的高度。</li>
<li><code>Elevation</code> 输入基站的海拔高度，单位是毫米，所以如果你要设置海平面以上 40 米，请输入 <code>40000</code>。</li>
</ul>
<p>保存设置。暂时不用重启基站，下一步配置完基站到 Open5GS 核心网的连接后再一起重启。</p>
<h2 id="修改基站的核心网连接配置">修改基站的核心网连接配置</h2>
<p>下一步是让基站连接 Open5GS 核心网，从而传输用户信息和数据流量。</p>

<li><code>Tunnel Type</code> 选择 IPv4。此时基站到核心网之间的数据是明文传输。
<ul>
<li>由于我们的基站和核心网在同一个局域网下，都由我们物理控制，所以这里的安全风险不大。但如果你的基站需要通过互联网连接到核心网，你应该尝试使用 <code>IPSEC</code> 选项，但相应的你需要额外配置 IPSec 隧道的相关设置。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>MME IP Address</code> 输入 <code>Open5GS</code> 核心网机器的 IP 地址。
<ul>
<li>如果你的 <code>Open5GS</code> 核心网的不同组件安装在不同机器上，此处输入运行 MME 组件机器的 IP 地址。</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<p>保存设置，这里建议重启一次基站以保证设置生效。保存设置时基站可能会自动重启，但如果基站没有重启，可以点击管理界面右上角的电源按钮手动重启一次，或者手动断电重启。</p>
<p>重启完成后，稍等片刻，看一下基站的指示灯，最左侧的 LTE 状态指示灯应该是蓝灯常亮，代表此时已经在发射 LTE 信号。到这里，基站的配置就全部完成了。</p>
<p>拿出你的手机，随便选择一张 SIM 卡，关闭「自动选择网络」选项，手机就会自动搜索附近的移动网络。如果你的手机支持 LTE 48 频段，你应该就能看到一个名为 <code>Lan Tian Mobile</code>（或者你自己配置的网络名称）的网络，这就是你的基站发射的信号。</p>
<p>基站管理面板上也应该显示 <code>henb running</code>，代表基站运行正常：</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-status.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-status.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-status.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202507/sercomm-status.png" alt="Sercomm 基站状态页面"></picture></p>
<h1 id="将-sim-卡信息注册到-open5gs-上">将 SIM 卡信息注册到 Open5GS 上</h1>
<p>核心网和基站正常运行后，就可以将 SIM 卡注册到核心网上，让使用这些 SIM 卡的手机等设备连接 LTE 网络了。</p>
<p>准备几张可编程 SIM 卡，按照<a href="https://lantian.pub/article/modify-computer/legal-lte-network-at-home-for-100-bucks.lantian/#%E5%86%99-sim-%E5%8D%A1">上一篇文章中的写 SIM 卡教程</a>给你的 SIM 卡写入认证信息。记录下 SIM 卡的 IMSI/KI/OPC 信息。</p>
<p>登录 Open5GS 的 Web 管理面板，然后点击 <code>Add a subscriber</code>：</p>

<ul>
<li><code>IMSI</code> 输入 SIM 卡对应的 IMSI 信息。</li>
<li><code>Subscriber Key</code> 输入 SIM 卡的 <code>KI</code>。</li>
<li><code>Operator Key</code> 输入 SIM 卡的 <code>OPC</code>。</li>
</ul>
<p>其它选项全部保持默认，点击 Save 保存。</p>
<p>把 SIM 卡插到你的手机上，稍等片刻，手机就应该可以连上你的移动网络了。</p>
<h1 id="总结">总结</h1>
<p>本文主要记录搭建 Open5GS 时与 Magma 核心网不同的步骤，以及在 NixOS 上搭建时特有的一些问题。相比 Magma，Open5GS 的安装流程更加简单，而且不依赖 Docker 等容器化管理工具。如果你用的是 Ubuntu，上面的大部分流程其实在 <code>apt install</code> 时就已经自动完成。</p>
<p>从 LTE 终端设备（例如手机）的角度来看，使用这两款核心网软件并没有什么区别，两者的延迟、网络带宽都没有大的差别，主要还是受到 LTE 通信本身的限制。（除了我使用 Magma 时遇到的，Android 手机无法正常认证的奇怪 Bug）</p>
<p>我切换到 Open5GS，也是为了开头提到的管理上的便利。你可以根据自己的喜好，选择 Open5GS 或者 Magma 之一。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SideStore</a> is a commonly used iOS app sideloading tool that allows you to install third-party apps bypassing the App Store. It works by using your Apple ID to obtain a free Apple developer certificate, which is then used to sign the app you want to install, allowing it to run normally on your iOS device.</p>
<p>However, to maintain control over the iOS ecosystem, Apple prevents third-party app stores from using developer certificates to bypass restrictions on a large scale, setting a 7-day expiration period for developer certificates. Users need to regularly obtain new developer certificates and re-sign their apps to continue using the third-party apps they have installed.</p>
<p>Traditional sideloading tools, such as AltStore, rely on software like iTunes on a computer for the re-signing process. But unlike other sideloading tools, SideStore only requires computer assistance for the initial installation. After installation, SideStore can simulate a computer with iTunes installed, allowing the iOS system to communicate with it through a virtual network, thus achieving the effect of re-signing apps and even installing new third-party apps without a computer.</p>
<p>SideStore's virtual network can generally be implemented in the following two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>WireGuard: SideStore can create a WireGuard server on the device itself. Users can install a WireGuard client and connect to this server, allowing the iOS system to communicate with the simulated computer over the network.
<ul>
<li>The disadvantage of this method is that due to iOS system limitations, when the iPhone/iPad is using cellular data, the WireGuard client cannot connect to the WireGuard server created locally by SideStore. Therefore, SideStore only works properly when the device is connected to Wi-Fi.</li>
<li>Also, since the iOS system only supports connecting to one VPN at a time, if the user needs to use another VPN software, they have to manually switch between VPNs, which is quite troublesome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SideStore/StosVPN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StosVPN</a>: A dedicated VPN client developed by the SideStore team that works exclusively for SideStore.
<ul>
<li>Compared to WireGuard, StosVPN is not affected by iOS restrictions and can work normally when the device is using cellular data. However, after trying it out, I found that StosVPN often disconnects automatically and cannot stay in the background for a long time. If the iOS device is not used for a while and StosVPN disconnects, and SideStore and other third-party apps fail to renew in time, you will have to find a computer to sign these apps again.</li>
<li>Also, since StosVPN is also a VPN, it is also subject to the iOS's limitation of only supporting one VPN connection at a time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I wanted to try to analyze the working principles of SideStore/StosVPN to see if I could integrate them into my home network or ZeroTier SDN network, allowing SideStore to refresh normally without extra VPN configuration.</p>
<h2 id="how-stosvpn-works">How StosVPN Works</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://github.com/SideStore/StosVPN/blob/main/TunnelProv/PacketTunnelProvider.swift" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StosVPN's packet processing logic</a>, StosVPN roughly does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigns IP address <code>10.7.0.0</code> to the iOS device, and configure iOS to send packets for <code>10.7.0.0/24</code> to StosVPN.</li>
<li>Defines an IP address <code>10.7.0.1</code>, where StosVPN will simulate a computer with iTunes installed.</li>
<li>For each packet:
<ul>
<li>If the packet is sent from <code>10.7.0.0</code> to <code>10.7.0.1</code>, swap the source and destination IP addresses, to send the packet back to the iOS device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This logic is quite simple. SideStore essentially opens some ports locally on the iOS device, simulating a computer with iTunes installed. Suppose iOS creates a connection like this when trying to connect to the simulated computer:</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">TCP</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> 10.7.0.0:12345</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000"> -> </span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515">10.7.0.1:54321</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Then WireGuard or StosVPN will swap the source and destination IP addresses (but not the port numbers), rewrite the packet as follows, and send it back to the iOS device:</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">TCP</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> 10.7.0.1:12345</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000"> -> </span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515">10.7.0.0:54321</span></span></code></pre>
<p>From the iOS device's perspective, this is a new TCP connection from <code>10.7.0.1</code>, unrelated to the previous connection sent to the computer. Since the port iOS is trying to connect to (<code>54321</code> in this case) should be an iTunes port, and SideStore simulates iTunes locally, SideStore should be listening on port <code>54321</code> at this time and receiving the data.</p>
<p>After SideStore's simulated iTunes logic processes the data and generates a reply:</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">TCP</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> 10.7.0.0:54321</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000"> -> </span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515">10.7.0.1:12345</span></span></code></pre>
<p>WireGuard or StosVPN will again swap the source and destination IP addresses:</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">TCP</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> 10.7.0.1:54321</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000"> -> </span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515">10.7.0.0:12345</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This reply packet matches the initial connection sent to the simulated computer. iOS therefore believes it has received a reply from iTunes on the computer, and thus continues updating the developer certificate.</p>
<h2 id="simulating-stosvpns-working-logic-with-nftables">Simulating StosVPN's Working Logic with Nftables</h2>
<p>Now understanding how StosVPN works, we just need to mimic its logic in our own network.</p>
<p>If you only have a few iOS devices, and they are all assigned static IP addresses, and you have a router running OpenWrt or another Linux system, you can simply use the following Nftables rules:</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">table</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> inet</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> sidestore</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> {</span></span>

<p>The purpose of the above rules is that if a packet is received from your iOS device (<code>192.168.0.123</code> or <code>192.168.0.234</code>) destined for <code>10.7.0.1</code> (the virtual computer), it changes the packet's source IP to <code>10.7.0.1</code> (the virtual computer) and the destination IP to your iOS device (<code>192.168.0.123</code> or <code>192.168.0.234</code>), and then sends it out. The <code>notrack</code> here disables connection tracking, which prevents Linux from matching these packets to previously received packets and connection tracking entries, which could make the rules ineffective.</p>
<p>Since Nftables does not support using packet source/destination IP addresses as variables, it's not possible to achieve the purpose of "swapping source and destination addresses" with a single set of rules. Therefore, we need to add a rule for each iOS device. If you have a small number of iOS devices, you can write a separate rule for each device's IP address. However, if you have many devices, or if they don't have static IP addresses, you will need to write a rule for every IP address in your home network segment, which can be very troublesome. Also, if your router does not support Nftables or similar firewall functions and cannot rewrite packets in a similar way, you cannot achieve this functionality.</p>
<h2 id="sidestore-vpn-tool">SideStore VPN Tool</h2>
<p>If you cannot use the above method, I have also written a small program that implements the above logic: <a href="https://github.com/xddxdd/sidestore-vpn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SideStore VPN Tool</a>. It can create a TUN interface on a Linux device, listen for packets destined for <code>10.7.0.1</code>, and process these packets with the same logic as StosVPN.</p>
<p>To use this tool in your network, you need a device running Linux (such as a Raspberry Pi or a virtual machine), connect it to the same LAN as your iOS devices, and set a static IP address. Since the packets rewritten by the tool can be seen as a new connection from this Linux device to the iOS device, there should be no firewall or NAT between the iOS device and this Linux device, otherwise this new connection will be blocked, preventing SideStore's simulated computer from receiving requests normally.</p>
<p>Then, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable IP Forwarding on the Linux device:</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="前言">前言</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SideStore</a> 是一款常用的 iOS 应用侧载工具，可以绕过 App Store 安装第三方应用。它的工作原理是用你的 Apple ID 获取免费的苹果开发者证书，给你要安装的应用签名，从而让应用可以在 iOS 设备上正常运行。</p>
<p>然而，苹果为了维护其对 iOS 生态系统的控制，阻止第三方应用商店使用开发者证书大规模地绕过限制，对开发者证书设置了 7 天的过期时间。用户需要定期获取新的开发者证书，重新给应用签名，才能一直使用自己安装的第三方应用。</p>
<p>传统的侧载工具，例如 AltStore，都依赖电脑上的 iTunes 等软件进行重新签名的操作。但 SideStore 与其它侧载工具不同，它只有首次安装时需要电脑辅助。安装完成后，SideStore 可以自己模拟一台安装了 iTunes 的电脑，让 iOS 系统通过虚拟网络与其通信，从而实现无需电脑就能给应用重新签名，甚至安装新的第三方应用的效果。</p>
<p>SideStore 的虚拟网络一般可以用下面两种方式实现：</p>
<ul>
<li>WireGuard：SideStore 可以在本机上创建一个 WireGuard 服务器。用户可以自行安装 WireGuard 客户端，并连接到这个服务器上，从而让 iOS 系统可以通过网络和模拟出的电脑通信。
<ul>
<li>这种方法的缺点是，受到 iOS 系统限制，当 iPhone/iPad 通过移动网络上网时，WireGuard 客户端是连不上 SideStore 本地创建的 WireGuard 服务器的。因此，SideStore 只有在设备连接到 Wi-Fi 时才能正常工作。</li>
<li>同时，由于 iOS 系统只支持同时连接一个 VPN，如果用户需要使用别的 VPN 软件，就只能手动切换 VPN，操作比较麻烦。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SideStore/StosVPN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StosVPN</a>：是 SideStore 团队开发的专用 VPN 客户端，只能用于 SideStore。
<ul>
<li>相比于 WireGuard，StosVPN 不会受到 iOS 的限制，可以在设备通过移动网络上网时正常工作。但是我试用后发现，StosVPN 无法长时间保持在后台运行，经常会自动断开。如果有一段时间没有使用 iOS 设备，同时 StosVPN 断开了连接，SideStore 以及其它第三方应用没能及时续期，就只能重新连接电脑，给这些应用签名了。</li>
<li>同时，由于 StosVPN 也是 VPN，它同样受到 iOS 系统只支持同时连接一个 VPN 的限制。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>于是我就想尝试分析 SideStore/StosVPN 的工作原理，看看能不能把它们集成到我的家庭网络或者 ZeroTier SDN 网络里，让 SideStore 无需额外的 VPN 配置就能正常刷新。</p>
<h2 id="stosvpn-的工作原理">StosVPN 的工作原理</h2>
<p>根据 <a href="https://github.com/SideStore/StosVPN/blob/main/TunnelProv/PacketTunnelProvider.swift" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StosVPN 的关键数据包处理逻辑</a>，StosVPN 大致做了以下几件事：</p>
<ul>
<li>给 iOS 设备分配 IP <code>10.7.0.0</code>，让 iOS 把 <code>10.7.0.0/24</code> 这个网段的数据包发送到 StosVPN。</li>
<li>定义了一个 IP <code>10.7.0.1</code>，StosVPN 将在这个 IP 上模拟装了 iTunes 的电脑。</li>
<li>对于每个数据包：
<ul>
<li>如果数据包是从 <code>10.7.0.0</code> 发给 <code>10.7.0.1</code> 的，就交换数据包的来源和目标 IP，从而把数据包发回给 iOS 设备。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>这个逻辑看起来很简单，实际上也一点都不复杂。实际上，SideStore 就是在 iOS 设备本地打开了一系列端口，模拟安装了 iTunes 的电脑。假设 iOS 在尝试连接模拟出的电脑时创建了这样一条连接：</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">TCP</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> 10.7.0.0:12345</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000"> -> </span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515">10.7.0.1:54321</span></span></code></pre>
<p>那么 WireGuard 或者 StosVPN 就会交换来源和目标 IP（但不交换端口号），将数据包改写成以下的样子并发回 iOS 设备：</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">TCP</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> 10.7.0.1:12345</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000"> -> </span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515">10.7.0.0:54321</span></span></code></pre>
<p>从 iOS 设备看来，这是一条从 <code>10.7.0.1</code> 发来的新 TCP 连接，与上一条发往电脑的连接没什么关系。由于 iOS 尝试连接到的端口（此处以 <code>54321</code> 示例）应当是 iTunes 的端口，而 SideStore 又在本地模拟了 iTunes，所以 SideStore 此时也应在监听 <code>54321</code> 端口，并收到了数据。</p>
<p>SideStore 模拟 iTunes 的逻辑处理完数据，并生成一个回复：</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">TCP</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> 10.7.0.0:54321</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000"> -> </span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515">10.7.0.1:12345</span></span></code></pre>
<p>WireGuard 或者 StosVPN 又会交换来源和目标 IP：</p>
<pre class="shiki shiki-themes dark-plus light-plus" style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark-bg:#1E1E1E;--shiki-light-bg:#FFFFFF" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-dark:#DCDCAA;--shiki-light:#795E26">TCP</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515"> 10.7.0.1:54321</span><span style="--shiki-dark:#D4D4D4;--shiki-light:#000000"> -> </span><span style="--shiki-dark:#CE9178;--shiki-light:#A31515">10.7.0.0:12345</span></span></code></pre>
<p>这一个回复数据包就对上了最开始发往电脑的连接。iOS 因此认为自己收到了电脑上 iTunes 的回复，从而继续更新开发者证书。</p>
<h2 id="用-nftables-模拟-stosvpn-的工作逻辑">用 Nftables 模拟 StosVPN 的工作逻辑</h2>
<p>了解了 StosVPN 的工作原理，我们只需要在自己的网络里模仿它的工作逻辑就可以了。</p>

<p>由于 Nftables 不支持将数据包的来源/目标 IP 等信息用作变量，无法用一组规则实现「交换来源和目标地址」的目的，所以我们需要给每台 iOS 设备都添加一条规则。如果你的 iOS 设备比较少，可以给每个设备的 IP 都单独写一条规则。但如果你的设备很多，或者没有固定 IP，你就需要给家庭网段内的每一个 IP 都写一条规则，非常麻烦。同时，如果你的路由器不支持 Nftables 或类似的防火墙功能，无法用类似的方式改写数据包，也无法实现这样的功能。</p>
<h2 id="sidestore-vpn-工具">SideStore VPN 工具</h2>
<p>如果你无法使用上面的方法，我也写了一个实现上述逻辑的小工具：<a href="https://github.com/xddxdd/sidestore-vpn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SideStore VPN 工具</a>。它可以在 Linux 设备上创建一个 TUN 接口，监听发往 <code>10.7.0.1</code> 的数据包，并用和 StosVPN 相同的逻辑处理这些数据包。</p>
<p>要在你的网络内使用这个工具，你需要准备一台运行 Linux 的设备（例如树莓派或者虚拟机），将它连接到 iOS 设备所在的同一个内网中，并设置一个固定 IP。由于工具改写后的数据包可以看作是从这个 Linux 设备向 iOS 设备的一条新连接，所以 iOS 设备和这个 Linux 设备之间不能有防火墙或者 NAT，否则这条新连接会被拦截，导致 SideStore 的模拟电脑无法正常收到请求。</p>
<p>然后，执行以下操作：</p>

<li>在 Linux 设备上开启 IP 转发（IP Forwarding）：</li>

<h2 id="origin">Origin</h2>
<p>Due to a somewhat absurd reason (calculating the physical distance between VPS
to estimate network latency), I
<a href="https://lantian.pub/en/article/modify-computer/nix-trigonometric-math-library-from-zero.lantian/">implemented a somewhat absurd trigonometric function library using Nix</a>.
After I
<a href="https://github.com/xddxdd/nix-math" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published the trigonometric function library on GitHub</a>,
I found that someone actually used it! It seems my needs weren't too absurd
after all.</p>
<p>In the repository's Issues,
<a href="https://github.com/xddxdd/nix-math/issues/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a user suggested that I add some exponential/logarithmic function support to this math library</a>,
such as <code>exp</code>, <code>ln</code>, <code>pow</code>, and <code>log</code>.</p>
<p>Since implementing these basic functions from scratch is also quite interesting,
I took some time to research it. Among these four functions, <code>exp</code> and <code>ln</code> are
somewhat difficult. <code>pow</code> and <code>log</code> can both be derived from the other two
functions:</p>

<p>When I implemented the trigonometric function last time, I wrote code to
calculate the result of the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6679em;"></span><span class="mop">sin</span></span></span></span> function based on the Taylor series.
Therefore, we only need to copy the code and change the formula for calculating
a term in the series.</p>

<p>Obviously, this Taylor expansion never converges, so we cannot calculate the
result term by term and then sum them up. Therefore, we can use the same method

<p>Since we don't know how many terms to use in polynomial regression to get the
best result, I wrote a simple script using Python and Numpy to try from 1 term
to 100 terms and then select the fitting result with the smallest error:</p>

<h2 id="起因">起因</h2>
<p>由于一个有点离谱的原因（计算 VPS 间的物理距离来估算网络延迟），我<a href="https://lantian.pub/article/modify-computer/nix-trigonometric-math-library-from-zero.lantian/">用 Nix 实现了一个有点离谱的三角函数库</a>。我把三角函数库<a href="https://github.com/xddxdd/nix-math" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">发布到 GitHub 上</a>后，发现居然有人用！看来我的需求也不算太离谱。</p>
<p>在仓库的 Issues 里，<a href="https://github.com/xddxdd/nix-math/issues/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">有用户建议我给这个数学库添加一些指数/对数函数支持</a>，例如 <code>exp</code>，<code>ln</code>，<code>pow</code> 和 <code>log</code>。</p>
<p>因为从零开始实现这些基础函数也挺有趣的，所以我就抽空研究了一下。这四个函数中，有些难度的是 <code>exp</code> 和 <code>ln</code>。<code>pow</code> 和 <code>log</code> 都可以用另外两个函数转化出来：</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, you read that right. Without the need for Faraday cages or signal-blocking measures, you can build a legal LTE network at home (in the US) for around $100, capable of transmitting continuously 24/7.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding "legal": I am not a lawyer or a wireless expert. Based on my research into the relevant policies and regulations, my entire setup should be legal. However, I take no responsibility if you encounter any legal issues after following the instructions in this post.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="cbrs-band-unlicensed-lte5g-band-in-the-us">CBRS Band: Unlicensed LTE/5G Band in the US</h1>
<p>The challenge in building your own LTE network lies not in the technology but in legally acquiring radio spectrum resources. On the software side, as early as 2014, solutions like <a href="https://www.srslte.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">srsRAN</a> based on SDR (Software Defined Radio) for LTE transmission were available, along with open-source core network software like <a href="https://magmacore.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Magma</a> and <a href="https://open5gs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open5GS</a>.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to radio spectrum, the frequencies used by LTE and 5G mobile networks fall within licensed bands. To use them legally, you must apply to the local radio regulatory authority and pay expensive spectrum usage fees (usually based on coverage area and local population). Unless you live in a sparsely populated area, most enthusiasts will be stopped at this step. If you transmit without authorization, you will interfere with operators using the same frequency, and the affected operators have a strong incentive to collaborate with enforcement agencies to locate the source of interference and heavily fine you.</p>
<p>In 2017, however, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened the 3550-3700 MHz band to the public, known as the CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) band. Anyone who meets simple restrictions can transmit on this band without prior authorization. Since this band corresponds to LTE band 48 and 5G band n48, you can transmit LTE or 5G signals on this band, allowing phones that support band 48 to connect, thereby legally establishing your own LTE/5G network.</p>
<p>If many devices transmit on the same band without coordination, severe signal interference will occur, rendering the band unusable for everyone. To address this, CBRS introduced the SAS system (Spectrum Access System) to manage all radio devices transmitting on the CBRS band. SAS categorizes CBRS users into three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incumbent Access: Users who were authorized to use this band before 2017 have the highest priority. These are typically satellite control stations and US Navy radars. If these users transmit on the CBRS band, all other users must yield.</li>
<li>Priority Access: Users who have obtained priority usage rights for portions of the CBRS band through auctions have a lower priority than incumbent users but higher than all other users.</li>
<li>General Authorized Access: All other users without prior authorization have the lowest priority and must yield to all other users.</li>
</ul>
<p>All CBRS band users, except the US Navy, must obtain authorization from SAS before starting transmission, allowing SAS to dynamically adjust frequency allocations in different areas to prevent mutual interference. For interference from US Navy radars, SAS uses signal receivers installed along the US coast to determine if the US Navy is using the band.</p>
<p>Therefore, with a LTE/5G base station that supports the CBRS band and can connect to SAS to obtain frequency allocations, you can legally transmit signals and build your own mobile network.</p>
<p>But where can you buy such a device?</p>
<h2 id="buying-a-used-base-station-on-ebay">Buying a Used Base Station on eBay</h2>
<p>After the CBRS band was opened, it attracted the interest of many companies. <a href="https://ongoalliance.org/members/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As of today, 95 companies have joined the CBRS Alliance</a>, including the big three US operators AT&#x26;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, SAS system operators Google and Federated Wireless, and base station equipment manufacturers Baicells and Sercomm, among others.</p>
<p>Another company called Nova Labs was also interested in CBRS. Nova Labs operates a virtual network operator (MVNO) called Helium Mobile, providing services through T-Mobile's mobile network. To achieve lower costs and lower plan prices than other virtual operators, they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sold Wi-Fi hotspots and CBRS base stations dedicated to the Helium Mobile network, allowing users to share their existing broadband connection.</li>
<li>Prioritized Helium Mobile users to use these Wi-Fi hotspots and CBRS base stations, bypassing T-Mobile to reduce data traffic costs.</li>
<li>Issued a digital currency called HNT, and used HNT to pay for traffic cost on Wi-Fi hotspots and CBRS base stations.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Nova Labs could never solve the stability issues of roaming to CBRS base stations and eventually abandoned the CBRS network entirely in March 2025, fully transitioning to using Wi-Fi hotspots. The CBRS base stations, originally costing thousands of dollars, were replaced and now listed on eBay for around $60 each. After flashing back to the original firmware and unlocking the management interface, these base stations can connect to core networks built with Magma, Open5GS, etc., and transmit for your own LTE network.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=cbrs&#x26;_sacat=0&#x26;_sop=15" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Search for "CBRS" on eBay</a> to find many CBRS base stations from the Helium Mobile network.</p>
<p>Note that Helium Mobile sells two types of CBRS base stations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indoor base stations produced by Sercomm, branded by FreedomFi or MosoLabs, model <code>SCE4255W</code>, characterized by the FreedomFi or MosoLabs logo on the casing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Outdoor base stations produced by Baicells, model <code>Nova 430h</code>, characterized by the orange Baicells logo on the casing.</li>
</ul>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/cbrs-outdoor-radio.jpg.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/cbrs-outdoor-radio.jpg.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/cbrs-outdoor-radio.jpg.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202504/cbrs-outdoor-radio.jpg" alt="Baicells Outdoor Base Station Appearance"></picture></p>
<p>(Image source: Amazon)</p>
<p>If you are deploying at home, <strong>you must buy an indoor base station</strong>, not an outdoor one. The differences between the two are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indoor base stations can only be used indoors. They can easily connect to SAS without additional steps.</li>
<li>Outdoor base stations can only be used outdoors. They have higher SAS authorization fees, and require a CBRS Alliance-authorized installer to check the installation before transmission can begin. If you want to install an outdoor base station but can't find an authorized installer, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-cbrs-cpi-training" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">you can also spend $600 to get certified as an authorized installer</a>, valid for 3 years, and then you can approve your own base stations and install as many base stations as you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't want to spend $600 on a certification that has little other use, so I bought an indoor base station directly.</p>
<h2 id="unlocking-the-management-interface-of-the-indoor-base-station">Unlocking the Management Interface of the Indoor Base Station</h2>
<p>When you buy a FreedomFi/Sercomm SCE4255W indoor base station from eBay, plug it in and turn it on, you'll find you can't connect to the base station's web management interface to change its configuration. This was done to prevent base station owners from messing with the settings, which could affect network stability, but it also prevents us from using the base station elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, these base stations connect to a central server to get configurations via the HTTP-based TR-069 protocol, a term you might be familiar with if you've ever modified your model or router provided by ISP. We can hijack the default control server address to our own control server, allowing us to freely modify the base station's configuration.</p>
<p>If you plan to use Magma to build your core network, you can skip this step. Magma comes with a TR-069 server that can send configurations to the base station, and engineers from Helium Mobile and FreedomFi have already added support for this base station to Magma, so we can later hijack the base station's control server <code>acs.freedomfi.com</code> to Magma via DNS.</p>
<p>If you plan to use Open5GS or other software that doesn't support TR-069 to build your core network, you can use my script to simulate a TR-069 server and send the command to enable the web management interface to the base station:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the <code>tr069.py</code> script from <a href="https://github.com/xddxdd/freedomfi-cbrs-enable-webui" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/xddxdd/freedomfi-cbrs-enable-webui</a>.</li>
<li>Install Python 3, then run <code>python3 tr069.py</code>.</li>
<li>Modify your router's DNS settings to hijack the IP of <code>acs.freedomfi.com</code> to the IP of the computer running the <code>tr069.py</code> script. My router uses OpenWRT, so I can add a rule in the Dnsmasq configuration page: <code>/acs.freedomfi.com/192.168.4.2</code>.</li>
<li>Unbox the base station, connect it with an Ethernet cable, and plug in the power.</li>
<li>Wait a moment, and you should see a large amount of XML output in the window running the <code>tr069.py</code> script, which are the commands sent by the base station to the server. If you aren't receiving any requests, check if the DNS configuration is correct and if there's a firewall on your computer blocking port 8443.</li>
<li>When you see output containing <code>cwmp:SetParameterValuesResponse</code>, it means the web management interface has been successfully enabled. The complete output should look like this:</li>

<h2 id="purchasing-programmable-sim-cards">Purchasing Programmable SIM Cards</h2>
<p>After building your LTE network, you'll need some SIM cards with your network's configuration programmed on them to allow phones to connect to your network. Since the information on regular SIM cards is hardcoded during production, you can't just buy any SIM card; you must use programmable SIM cards.</p>
<p>Search for <code>Programmable SIM</code> on shopping websites like Amazon and Aliexpress to find these cards, for example: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Programmable+SIM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Programmable+SIM</a>.</p>

<p>(Image source: Amazon)</p>
<p>I bought a set of SIM cards on Amazon for $38.99, which included 5 programmable SIM cards, a card programmer, a USB drive with Windows card-programming software, and an adapter from Micro SIM/Nano SIM to full-size SIM.</p>
<h1 id="building-a-magma-core-network">Building a Magma Core Network</h1>
<p>To build your own LTE network, you first need a core network. The LTE core network mainly manages user device (e.g., phone) authentication information and controls billing, traffic throttling, and other functions.</p>
<p>Magma is an open-source 4G/5G core network developed by Meta (Facebook), running on Docker/Kubernetes. It can quickly scale horizontally to support large amounts of mobile network traffic and can run on low-spec devices like Raspberry Pi to provide simple network services.</p>
<p>Since I don't need the complex container orchestration features of Kubernetes, I chose to build Magma's components using Docker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I referenced the following materials during the configuration process:</p>

<h2 id="building-the-magma-core-network-orchestrator-and-nms">Building the Magma Core Network (Orchestrator and NMS)</h2>
<p>First, prepare a system to run the core network. I chose to create a virtual machine on Proxmox VE. After installation, the system services and Magma together use about 4GB of memory, so a virtual machine with about 8GB of memory should be sufficient.</p>
<p>I installed Ubuntu 24.04, but other systems should theoretically work as well.</p>
<p>Then, install Docker and Docker-compose.</p>

<p>After completing the above configuration, you now have an LTE core network. However, your base station cannot directly connect to the core network; it needs another component: the Access Gateway (AGW).</p>
<h2 id="building-the-magma-access-gateway-agw">Building the Magma Access Gateway (AGW)</h2>
<p>Magma's Access Gateway manages the base station and forwards the base station's data traffic to the internet. Note that Magma's core network only manages user information and does not handle data traffic, and the traffic from the Access Gateway does not pass through the core network.</p>
<p>First, prepare a system to run the Access Gateway. This system needs to be configured with two network interfaces, where <code>eth0</code> is used for remote management and connecting to the core network, and <code>eth1</code> is used for connecting to the base station. If you're using a separate computer, you'll need to plug the base station's Ethernet cable into the <code>eth1</code> interface later, and Magma will automatically configure DHCP to allow the base station to connect to the Access Gateway. However, since I'm using a virtual machine on Proxmox VE, I chose to place the additional <code>eth1</code> interface in a VLAN and set up the corresponding VLAN and IP on the main router. This way, I can ping the <code>eth1</code> IP from any machine on my local network, meaning the base station can be plugged into any port on my main switch.</p>
<p>This system must be installed with Ubuntu 20.04 because the Magma Access Gateway installation modifies many system configurations, and these modifications are only supported on Ubuntu 20.04.</p>
<p>After installation, the system services and Magma together use about 1GB of memory, so a virtual machine with about 2-4GB of memory should be sufficient.</p>
<p>Then, install Docker and Docker-compose.</p>

<p>Although we've added the base station to Magma, since the base station device defaults to connecting to Helium Mobile's server for configuration, it still can't connect to our Access Gateway properly. Therefore, we need to hijack the base station's control server <code>acs.freedomfi.com</code> to the <code>eth1</code> IP address of Magma access gateway via DNS. Modify your router's DNS settings to hijack the IP of <code>acs.freedomfi.com</code> to the <code>eth1</code> IP of the machine running the Access Gateway. My router uses OpenWRT, so I can add a rule in the Dnsmasq configuration page: <code>/acs.freedomfi.com/192.168.4.2</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, because the port number of the TR-069 server on the Magma Access Gateway is different from Helium Mobile's, we need to modify the port number and some other configurations on the Access Gateway.</p>
<p>On the Access Gateway, edit <code>nano /etc/magma/enodebd.yml</code> and make the following changes:</p>

<p>After saving the configuration file, reboot the entire Access Gateway system. I found during testing that restarting individual Docker containers on the Access Gateway can cause strange issues, such as the base station not being able to connect to the Access Gateway. A full reboot can resolve most strange issues.</p>
<p>Wait a moment, and the core network management interface should show the status of this base station as <code>Health</code> being <code>Good</code>. If the status remains <code>Bad</code>, try rebooting the Access Gateway.</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-enodeb-status.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-enodeb-status.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-enodeb-status.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202504/magma-enodeb-status.png" alt="Magma Base Station Status Interface"></picture></p>
<p>If you added the indoor base station's serial number to <code>web_ui_enable_list</code> to enable the management interface, you can now access the base station's management interface via HTTPS, like <code>https://192.168.1.123/</code>. The default username and password are <code>sc_femto</code> and <code>tsFid2wz</code> (from Helium Mobile's Discord: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/836735476659912754/1355330850232995861" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">link</a>).</p>
<h2 id="connecting-the-base-station-to-sas">Connecting the Base Station to SAS</h2>
<p>At this point, the base station is connected to your core network, but since it hasn't connected to the CBRS SAS system (Spectrum Access System) and obtained frequency authorization, it still won't transmit LTE signals.</p>
<p>We need to register an account with a SAS system and register our base station to obtain frequency authorization.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/spectrum-access-system" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google SAS</a>, a SAS system run by Google Cloud. Google SAS is currently the easiest SAS system to register with; other vendors' SAS systems usually require contacting sales and signing enterprise-level service contracts to use. Moreover, Google SAS is extremely affordable; at the time of writing, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/spectrum-access-system#pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the price for indoor base stations is $2.64 per month per unit, and for outdoor base stations, it's $13.15 per month per unit</a>.</p>
<p>You need to register a Google Cloud account first, then visit the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/spectrum-access" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SAS configuration page in the console</a> and follow these steps to configure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine your latitude and longitude. If you use an Android phone, you can download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GPS Status &#x26; Toolbox</a> app from Google Play to view your latitude and longitude. If you use an iPhone, you can view your latitude and longitude from the built-in Compass app.</li>
<li>In the console, select the "Add Site" button at the top (the one with a plus sign), and click anywhere on the map. A sidebar will pop up on the right, asking you to enter information about your base station.</li>
</ol>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-add-button.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-add-button.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-add-button.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-add-button.png" alt="Google SAS Add Site Button"></picture></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>First, switch to the first tab on the right sidebar (Location) and enter your correct latitude and longitude. It doesn't need to be very precise; the base station itself will upload its GPS location.</li>
</ol>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-enter-location.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-enter-location.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-enter-location.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-enter-location.png" alt="Google SAS Enter Latitude and Longitude Interface"></picture></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Then, switch to the second tab (Base Station Information) and fill in the following:
<ul>
<li><code>CBSD category</code> should be <code>A</code> for indoor base stations and <code>B</code> for outdoor base stations, based on your actual situation.</li>
<li><code>FCC ID</code> should be the FCC ID on the base station's label.</li>
<li><code>Serial number</code> should be the serial number on the base station's label.</li>
<li><code>Device type</code> should be <code>Indoor</code> (indoor) or <code>Outdoor</code> (outdoor), based on your actual situation.</li>
<li>Under <code>Air Interface</code>, select <code>E_UTRA</code> (corresponding to LTE) for <code>Radio technology</code>.</li>
<li>Under <code>Antenna</code>, fill in <code>Height</code> with your GPS altitude.</li>
<li>Under <code>Antenna</code>, select <code>Height type</code> as <code>AMSL</code> (height referenced to sea level).</li>
<li>Under <code>Antenna</code>, fill in <code>Azimuth</code> with the compass direction the base station faces.
<ul>
<li>For FreedomFi/Sercomm indoor base stations, since the antenna transmits in 360 degrees, the direction doesn't matter, so you can directly enter <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under <code>Antenna</code>, fill in <code>Mech downtilt</code> with the degree of downward tilt of the base station; if there's no tilt, you can directly enter <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Under <code>Antenna</code>, fill in <code>Horiz accuracy</code> with <code>10</code>.</li>
<li>Under <code>Antenna</code>, fill in <code>Vert accuracy</code> with <code>3</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You also need to fill in the following based on the base station's data sheet. If you're using a FreedomFi/Sercomm indoor base station, you can directly copy my configuration:
<ul>
<li><code>Max EIRP</code> should be <code>29</code> for FreedomFi/Sercomm indoor base stations.</li>
<li>Under <code>Antenna</code>, <code>Max gain</code> should be <code>5</code> for FreedomFi/Sercomm indoor base stations.</li>
<li>Under <code>Antenna</code>, <code>Beamwidth</code> should be <code>360</code> for FreedomFi/Sercomm indoor base stations.</li>
<li>Under <code>Antenna</code>, <code>Azimuth</code> should be <code>360</code> for FreedomFi/Sercomm indoor base stations.</li>
<li>Under <code>Measurement capability</code>, for FreedomFi/Sercomm indoor base stations, do not check <code>RX w/ grant</code>, but check <code>RX w/o grant</code>.</li>
<li>Under <code>Air Interface</code>, <code>Supported spec</code> should be <code>FFS</code> for FreedomFi/Sercomm indoor base stations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can leave the rest of the configurations blank; click <code>Ready for CPI</code>.</li>
<li>At this point, the page will display "The new configuration must be signed by a CPI before the CBSD registers with the SAS." If you're installing an indoor base station, you can ignore this. But if you're installing an outdoor base station, you'll need to find a Certified Professional Installer to approve the configuration, or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-cbrs-cpi-training" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spend $600 to get certified as a CPI</a>.</li>

<p>Reboot the base station: unplug the power from your base station, wait a few seconds, then plug it back in. After a few minutes, once the base station has started up and completed GPS positioning, the Google SAS configuration page should show some yellow-highlighted <code>Active config value</code>, indicating that these configurations differ from what you entered. You can ignore them.</p>
<p>Switch to the <code>Status</code> tab to view the device status; you should see the base station status as <code>Authorized</code> and the corresponding frequency allocation.</p>
<p>At this point, check the base station's indicator lights; the leftmost LTE status indicator light should be a steady blue, indicating that it's now transmitting LTE signals. This completes the base station configuration.</p>
<p>Take out your phone, select any SIM card, turn off the "Automatic Network Selection" option, and the phone will automatically search for nearby mobile networks. If your phone supports LTE band 48, you should see a network named 315010, which is the signal transmitted by your base station.</p>
<h1 id="programming-sim-cards">Programming SIM Cards</h1>
<p>With the LTE network in place, the next step is to program your network's authentication information onto the SIM cards, allowing phones to connect to your network.</p>
<p>When I bought the programmable SIM cards, the seller provided Windows card-programming software compatible with these SIM cards. I tried using pySim to program the cards on Linux, but the resulting SIM cards couldn't connect to the network for authentication, so I used Windows for this step.</p>
<p>Insert the SIM card programmer into your computer and insert a programmable SIM card into the programmer.</p>
<p>Open the card-programming software, first click the <code>Read Card</code> button in the top right to attempt to read the card's information, ensuring the programmer is connected properly.</p>
<p>Then, in the <code>LTE/WCDMA Parameter</code> section on the right, enter the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <code>IMSI15</code> and enter <code>3150109999XXXXX</code>, where the first ten digits are fixed, and the last five can be numbered arbitrarily.
<ul>
<li>The first six digits <code>315010</code> are the MCC/MNC for CBRS networks.</li>
<li>The next four digits <code>9999</code> are the IBN (IMSI Block Number) within the CBRS network; <code>9999</code> is the test number reserved for CBRS. The complete IBN allocation table can be found on the <a href="https://imsiadmin.com/assignments/cbrs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CBRS Assignments</a> webpage.</li>
<li>The last five digits can be any number you choose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure the <code>AD</code> field value is <code>00000003</code>. If it's different, click the edit button on the right and ensure the MNC length is set to 3.</li>
<li>In the <code>KI</code> and <code>OPC</code> fields, enter a random 32-character hexadecimal string for each. These strings are the authentication keys for the SIM card and cannot be read back once written to the SIM card.
<ul>
<li>Keep a backup of the <code>KI</code> and <code>OPC</code> values; you'll need to enter them into the Magma core network management page later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click the <code>Auto</code> button next to <code>PLMNwAct</code>, and the four input fields on the left should automatically fill with the values shown in the image.</li>
<li>Change the <code>SPN</code> to the operator name you want to display on your phone, for example, <code>Lan Tian Mobile</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, click the <code>Write Card</code> button in the top right to program the card.</p>
<p>If you want to program multiple SIM cards, follow the same process, but ensure that the <code>IMSI15</code>, <code>KI</code>, and <code>OPC</code> values are different for each card.</p>

<p>Return to the core network management interface at <a href="https://magma-test.magma.test" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://magma-test.magma.test</a> (or <code>magma-test.[your own domain]</code>), go to the left <code>Traffic</code> tab, then to the top <code>APNs</code> tab, and click <code>Create New APN</code> to create an APN.</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter <code>internet</code> for <code>APN ID</code>.</li>
<li>For <code>Max Required Bandwidth</code>, enter <code>1000000000</code> (1 Gbps, far exceeding the speed LTE can provide) for both upload and download.</li>
<li>Select <code>IPV4V6</code> for <code>PDN Type</code>.</li>
<li>Keep all other configurations at their defaults.</li>
</ul>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-apn.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-apn.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-apn.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-apn.png" alt="Magma Add APN Interface"></picture></p>
<p>Then, click the top <code>Data Plans</code> tab and click <code>Create New Data Plan</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can enter any value for <code>Data Plan ID</code>.</li>
<li>Keep both <code>Download</code> and <code>Upload</code> set to <code>Unlimited</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-data-plan.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-data-plan.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-data-plan.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-data-plan.png" alt="Magma Add Data Plan Interface"></picture></p>
<p>At this point, the data plan is created, and you can start registering SIM cards.</p>
<h2 id="registering-sim-cards">Registering SIM Cards</h2>
<p>Go to the left <code>Subscriber</code> tab in the management interface, then click <code>Manage Subscribers</code> - <code>Add Subscribers</code>.</p>
<p>For each SIM card you want to add, click the <code>Add New Row</code> button in the top right and enter the SIM card's information:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <code>IMSI</code> field, first enter <code>IMSI</code>, then the <code>IMSI15</code> you used when programming the card. For example: <code>IMSI315010999925470</code>.</li>
<li>You can enter any value for <code>Subscriber Name</code>.</li>
<li>Enter the <code>KI</code> you used when programming the card in the <code>Auth Key</code> field.</li>
<li>Enter the <code>OPC</code> you used when programming the card in the <code>Auth OPC</code> field.</li>
<li>Select <code>ACTIVE</code> for <code>Service</code> to enable the SIM card.</li>
<li>Select the data plan you created earlier for <code>Data Plan</code>.</li>
<li>Select the APN you created earlier for <code>Active APNs</code>.</li>
<li>Click the checkmark on the right to save.</li>
</ul>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-sim.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-sim.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-sim.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202504/magma-add-sim.png" alt="Magma Add SIM Card Interface"></picture></p>
<p>At this point, your SIM card is successfully registered with the Magma core network, and after a brief data synchronization, it will be ready for use.</p>
<h1 id="connecting-a-phone-to-the-network">Connecting a Phone to the Network</h1>
<p>Insert the SIM card into your phone. I used an iPhone SE 2022 for testing.</p>
<p>After inserting the SIM card and waiting a moment, the iPhone connected to my base station, showing full signal strength in the top left corner, with the network displayed as <code>315 010</code>, which is the MCC/MNC for CBRS:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/iphone-non-public-network-en.jpg.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/iphone-non-public-network-en.jpg.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/iphone-non-public-network-en.jpg.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202504/iphone-non-public-network-en.jpg" alt="iPhone Network Status"></picture></p>
<p>Using Speedtest to measure the speed, I achieved a download speed of 100 Mbps and an upload speed of 10 Mbps:</p>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/iphone-speedtest.jpg.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/iphone-speedtest.jpg.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/iphone-speedtest.jpg.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202504/iphone-speedtest.jpg" alt="iPhone Speedtest"></picture></p>
<p>I also tried an Android phone, a Motorola Edge+ 2023. Although this phone could see my LTE network, it couldn't connect to it properly, even with the same SIM card that worked on the iPhone. Further investigation is needed.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The total cost of all the equipment and services I used to build this LTE network (excluding sales tax) is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proxmox VE host for running virtual machines, my existing equipment: $0</li>
<li>FreedomFi/Sercomm indoor base station: $49 + shipping $12.3 = $61.3</li>
<li>Programmable SIM cards and card programmer: $38.99</li>
<li>Google SAS: $2.64/month, calculated for one month</li>
<li>Total cost: $102.93</li>
</ul>
<p>This price is not expensive for a Homelabber, far below the traditional belief that building an LTE network costs hundreds or thousands of dollars, and all the equipment and services can be easily purchased.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>是的，你没看错，不需要法拉第笼等信号屏蔽措施，只需要大概 100 美元，你就可以在（美国的）家里搭建一个合法的 LTE 网络，可以 24 小时连续发射。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>关于「合法」：我不是律师或者无线电专家。根据我对相关政策法规的研究，我的整套配置应当是合法的。但如果你按照本文操作后遇到了法律问题，我不负任何责任。</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="cbrs-频段美国的免授权-lte5g-频段">CBRS 频段：美国的免授权 LTE/5G 频段</h1>
<p>自建 LTE 网络的难点不在技术部分，而是在于合法地获取无线电频谱资源。软件方面，早在 2014 年就有了 <a href="https://www.srslte.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">srsRAN</a> 等基于 SDR（软件定义无线电）的 LTE 发射方案，也有 <a href="https://magmacore.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Magma</a>、<a href="https://open5gs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open5GS</a> 等开源的核心网软件。</p>
<p>但是在无线电频谱方面，LTE、5G 等移动网络使用的无线电频率都处在授权频段，需要向当地政府的无线电管理机构提出申请，并缴纳昂贵的频段使用费（一般根据覆盖范围和当地人口数）才能合法使用。除非你所在的地方人烟稀少，否则绝大部分爱好者都会被挡在这一步。如果你未经授权就占用频段强行发射，就会对使用同一频段的运营商造成干扰，而业务受损的运营商有很强的动力联合无线电执法部门搜查干扰源并且对你高额罚款。</p>
<p>不过 2017 年，美国联邦通信委员会（FCC）向公众开放了 3550-3700 MHz 这段无线电频谱，称为 CBRS（Citizens Broadband Radio Service，公民宽带无线电服务）频段。任何人只要满足简单的限制条件，都可以在这个频段上进行发射，不需要提前申请频段授权。由于这段频段正好是 LTE 的 48 频段和 5G 的 n48 频段，你可以在这段频段上发射 LTE 或者 5G 信号，让支持 48 频段的手机连接，从而合法地建立自己的 LTE/5G 网络。</p>
<p>如果大量设备未经协调就在同一个频段上发射信号，就会造成严重的信号干扰，导致大家都无法正常使用这个频段。为了解决这个问题，CBRS 引入了 SAS 系统（Spectrum Access System，频谱访问系统）管理所有在 CBRS 频段上发射的无线电设备。SAS 将 CBRS 的用户分成了三个级别：</p>
<ul>
<li>Incumbent Access（现有用户）：在 2017 年前就已经获得授权使用这段频段的用户，优先级最高。一般是卫星控制站，以及美国海军的雷达。如果这些用户在 CBRS 频段上发射，其它所有用户都要避让。</li>
<li>Priority Access（优先用户）：通过竞拍获得 CBRS 频段内部分频段优先使用权的用户，优先级低于现有用户，但高于其它所有用户。</li>
<li>General Authorized Access（通用授权用户）：其它未经事先授权的用户，优先级最低，需要避让其它所有用户。</li>
</ul>
<p>除了美国海军以外的所有 CBRS 频段用户开始发射时都需要向 SAS 申请授权许可，因此 SAS 可以动态调整各地的频段分配，保证频段上不出现互相干扰。对于美国海军的雷达干扰，SAS 则是通过在美国海岸安装信号接收器，来判断美国海军是否在使用频段。</p>
<p>因此，只要有一台支持 CBRS 频段，并且能连接到 SAS 获取频段分配的 LTE/5G 基站，就可以合法发射信号，自建移动网了。</p>
<p>但是，这样的设备在哪里可以买到呢？</p>
<h2 id="从-ebay-上购买二手基站">从 eBay 上购买二手基站</h2>
<p>CBRS 频段开放后，吸引了许多公司的兴趣。<a href="https://ongoalliance.org/members/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">截至今天，已有 95 家公司加入了 CBRS 联盟</a>，其中包括美国御三家运营商 AT&#x26;T、T-Mobile、Verizon，运营 SAS 系统的 Google 和 Federated Wireless，基站设备制造商 Baicells 和 Sercomm 等。</p>
<p>美国一家名为 Nova Labs 的公司也对 CBRS 感兴趣。Nova Labs 运营一家名为 Helium Mobile 的虚拟运营商（MVNO），通过 T-Mobile 的移动网络提供服务。为了追求比其它虚拟运营商更低的成本和更低的套餐价格，他们：</p>
<ul>
<li>出售 Helium Mobile 网络专用的 Wi-Fi 热点和 CBRS 基站，让用户共享自己已有的宽带。</li>
<li>让 Helium Mobile 用户优先使用这些 Wi-Fi 热点和 CBRS 基站，从而绕开 T-Mobile 降低数据流量成本。</li>
<li>发行数字货币 HNT，使用 HNT 支付 Wi-Fi 热点和 CBRS 基站的流量费。</li>
</ul>
<p>但是，Nova Labs 始终无法解决漫游到 CBRS 基站的稳定性问题，并最终在 2025 年 3 月完全放弃了 CBRS 网络，全面转向使用 Wi-Fi 热点。原本上千刀的 CBRS 基站就被换了下来，挂在 eBay 上以 $60 左右一台的价格出售。而这些基站在刷回原版固件、解锁管理界面后，就可以连接我们用 Magma、Open5GS 等自建的核心网，发射自己的 LTE 网络。</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=cbrs&#x26;_sacat=0&#x26;_sop=15" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">在 eBay 上搜索「CBRS」</a>，就可以找到很多 Helium Mobile 网络的 CBRS 基站。</p>
<p>要注意的是，Helium Mobile 出售两种 CBRS 基站：</p>
<ul>
<li>Sercomm 公司生产，FreedomFi 或者 MosoLabs 公司贴牌的室内基站，型号为 <code>SCE4255W</code>，其特征是外壳上只有 FreedomFi 或 MosoLabs 公司字样的 Logo。</li>
</ul>

<li>Baicells 公司生产的 <code>Nova 430h</code> 室外基站，特征是外壳上有橙色的 Baicells 公司 Logo。</li>

<p>如果你是在家部署，<strong>一定要购买室内基站</strong>，不能买室外基站。两种基站的区别在于：</p>
<ul>
<li>室内基站只能在室内使用，只需连接 SAS，无需额外步骤。</li>
<li>室外基站只能在室外使用，连接 SAS 的授权费更贵，而且安装时还需要 CBRS 联盟的授权安装人员检查安装情况，审批通过后才能开始发射。如果你想在室外装基站，却找不到授权安装人员，<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-cbrs-cpi-training" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">你也可以自己花 $600 考一个授权安装人员的证</a>，有效期 3 年，然后就可以审批自己的基站，想装多少基站就装多少了。</li>
</ul>
<p>我不想花 $600 考一个基本没别的用处的证，就直接买了室内基站。</p>
<h2 id="解锁室内基站的管理界面">解锁室内基站的管理界面</h2>
<p>你从 eBay 上买到 FreedomFi/Sercomm 的 SCE4255W 室内基站，插电开机后，会发现连不上基站的 Web 管理界面，无法修改配置。这是为了防止用户架设基站时乱改设置，影响网络稳定性，但是也防止了我们把基站用在别的地方。</p>
<p>不过，这些基站会通过基于 HTTP 的 TR-069 协议连接中央服务器获取配置，如果你自己破解过运营商的光猫或路由器应该会很熟悉这个名词。我们可以把默认控制服务器的地址劫持到我们自己的控制服务器上，就可以随意修改基站的配置了。</p>
<p>如果你准备使用 Magma 搭建核心网，可以先跳过这一步。Magma 自带一个 TR-069 服务器，可以给基站下发配置，而且 Helium Mobile 和 FreedomFi 的工程师已经给 Magma 添加了这款基站的支持，所以我们稍后把基站的控制服务器 <code>acs.freedomfi.com</code> 通过 DNS 劫持到 Magma 上就可以了。</p>
<p>如果你准备使用 Open5GS 或者其它不支持 TR-069 的软件搭建核心网，可以使用我的脚本模拟一个 TR-069 服务器，给基站下发开启 Web 管理界面的指令：</p>
<ol>
<li>从 <a href="https://github.com/xddxdd/freedomfi-cbrs-enable-webui" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/xddxdd/freedomfi-cbrs-enable-webui</a> 下载 <code>tr069.py</code> 脚本。</li>
<li>安装 Python 3，然后运行 <code>python3 tr069.py</code></li>
<li>修改你的路由器的 DNS 设置，把 <code>acs.freedomfi.com</code> 的 IP 劫持到运行 <code>tr069.py</code> 脚本的电脑 IP 上。我的路由器用的是 OpenWRT，可以在 Dnsmasq 配置页面中添加一条规则：<code>/acs.freedomfi.com/192.168.4.2</code></li>
<li>拿出基站，接上网线，插电开机。</li>
<li>稍等片刻，运行 <code>tr069.py</code> 脚本的窗口中会出现一大片 XML 输出，这些都是基站给服务器发送的指令。如果一直没收到请求，请检查 DNS 配置是否正确，以及电脑上有没有防火墙，是否开放了 8443 端口。</li>
<li>看到带有 <code>cwmp:SetParameterValuesResponse</code> 的输出，就代表 Web 管理界面开启成功了。完整输出应该类似：</li>

<h2 id="购买可编程-sim-卡">购买可编程 SIM 卡</h2>
<p>LTE 网络建成后，你还需要一批 SIM 卡，写入自己网络的配置，才可以让手机连上自己的网络。由于普通 SIM 卡的信息都在生产时直接写死了，你不能随便买 SIM 卡来用，必须用可编程的专用 SIM 卡。</p>
<p>在 Amazon、Aliexpress 等购物网站上搜索 <code>Programmable SIM</code> 可以找到这种卡，例如：<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Programmable+SIM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Programmable+SIM</a></p>

<h1 id="搭建-magma-核心网">搭建 Magma 核心网</h1>
<p>要搭建自己的 LTE 网络，我们首先需要一套核心网。LTE 核心网主要管理用户设备（例如手机）的认证信息，控制计费、流量限速等功能。</p>
<p>Magma 是 Meta（Facebook）公司开发的开源 4G/5G 核心网，在 Docker/Kubernetes 上运行，上可以快速横向扩展以支持大量移动网络流量，下可以跑在树莓派等低配设备上提供简单的网络服务。</p>
<p>由于我不需要 Kubernetes 复杂的容器调度功能，我选择简单的用 Docker 搭建 Magma 的各个组件。</p>

<p>完成以上配置后，你就有了一个 LTE 核心网。但是你的基站不能直接连接到核心网上，而是需要另一个组件：访问网关（Access Gateway）。</p>
<h2 id="搭建-magma-访问网关access-gateway">搭建 Magma 访问网关（Access Gateway）</h2>
<p>Magma 的访问网关负责管理基站，并将基站的数据流量转发到互联网。注意 Magma 的核心网只管理用户信息，不处理数据流量，访问网关的流量也不会经过核心网。</p>
<p>首先准备一个运行访问网关的系统。这个系统需要配置两张网卡，其中 <code>eth0</code> 用于远程管理和连接核心网，<code>eth1</code> 用于连接基站。如果你用的是一台单独的电脑，后续就要把基站的网线插到 <code>eth1</code> 网卡上，Magma 会自动配置好 DHCP，让基站连上访问网关。但因为我是在 Proxmox VE 上开虚拟机，所以我选择把额外添加的 <code>eth1</code> 网卡放在一个 VLAN 中，然后在主路由器上也添加对应的 VLAN 和 IP。这样我在局域网中的任何机器上都可以 ping 通 <code>eth1</code> 的 IP，也就是基站可以插到我的主交换机的任何一个接口上。</p>
<p>这个系统必须安装 Ubuntu 20.04 系统，因为 Magma 访问网关安装时会修改很多系统配置，而这些修改步骤只支持 Ubuntu 20.04。</p>
<p>安装完成后系统服务和 Magma 总计占用 1GB 左右内存，所以虚拟机开 2-4GB 左右内存应该足够。</p>
<p>然后，安装 Docker 和 Docker-compose。</p>
<p>然后，执行以下操作：</p>

<p>虽然我们在 Magma 上添加了基站，但因为基站设备默认连接 Helium Mobile 的服务器获取配置，它还是无法正常连上我们的访问网关。因此我们还需要把基站的控制服务器 <code>acs.freedomfi.com</code> 通过 DNS 劫持到 Magma 访问网关的 <code>eth1</code> IP 上。修改你的路由器的 DNS 设置，把 <code>acs.freedomfi.com</code> 的 IP 劫持到运行访问网关的机器 <code>eth1</code> IP 上。我的路由器用的是 OpenWRT，可以在 Dnsmasq 配置页面中添加一条规则：<code>/acs.freedomfi.com/192.168.4.2</code></p>
<p>然后，因为 Magma 访问网关的 TR-069 服务器端口号和 Helium Mobile 的不同，我们还需要在访问网关上修改端口号，和一些其它的配置。</p>
<p>在访问网关上 <code>nano /etc/magma/enodebd.yml</code>，做如下修改：</p>

<p>保存配置文件后，重启整个访问网关系统。我测试时发现单独重启访问网关的单个 Docker 容器可能会造成奇怪的问题，例如基站死活连不上访问网关。直接重启可以解决大部分奇怪的问题。</p>
<p>稍等片刻，核心网管理界面上应该会显示这个基站的状态 <code>Health</code> 为 <code>Good</code>。如果状态一直为 <code>Bad</code>，可以尝试重启访问网关。</p>

<h2 id="基站连接-sas">基站连接 SAS</h2>
<p>此时基站已经连上了你的核心网，但由于它还没有连上 CBRS 的 SAS 系统（Spectrum Access System，频谱访问系统），没有获得频段授权，所以仍然不会发射 LTE 信号。</p>
<p>我们还需要注册一个 SAS 系统的账号，把自己的基站注册上去，才能让基站获得频段授权。</p>
<p>我用的是 <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/spectrum-access-system" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google SAS</a>，由 Google Cloud 运行的 SAS 系统。Google SAS 是目前你能找到的注册最简单的 SAS 系统，其它厂商的 SAS 系统大都需要联系销售，签订企业级服务合同，才能使用。而且 Google SAS 的价格极其便宜，本文写作时，<a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/spectrum-access-system#pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">室内基站的价格是每台每月 $2.64，室外基站的价格是每台每月 $13.15</a>。</p>
<p>你需要先注册一个 Google Cloud 账号，然后访问<a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/spectrum-access" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">控制台的 SAS 配置页面</a>按照如下步骤进行配置。</p>
<ol>
<li>确定你的经纬度。如果你用的是 Android 手机，可以从 Google Play 下载 <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GPS Status &#x26; Toolbox</a> 软件查看你的经纬度。如果你用的是 iPhone，可以从自带的指南针查看经纬度。</li>
<li>在控制台上选择顶上的添加站点按钮（带有加号的按钮），在地图上随便点一个点。屏幕右侧会弹出一个侧边栏，让你输入基站的相关信息。</li>
</ol>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-add-button.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-add-button.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-add-button.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-add-button.png" alt="Google SAS 添加站点按钮"></picture></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>首先在右侧栏切换到第一个标签页（位置），输入你的正确的经纬度。不需要非常精准，基站本身也会上传自己的 GPS 位置。</li>
</ol>
<p><picture><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-enter-location.png.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-enter-location.png.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-enter-location.png.jxl" type="image/jxl"><img src="https://lantian.pub/usr/uploads/202504/google-sas-enter-location.png" alt="Google SAS 输入经纬度界面"></picture></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>然后切换到第二个标签页（基站信息），填写以下内容：
<ul>
<li><code>CBSD category</code> 根据实际情况，室内基站选择 <code>A</code>，室外基站选择 <code>B</code>。</li>
<li><code>FCC ID</code> 填写基站机身标签上的 FCC ID。</li>
<li><code>Serial number</code> 填写基站机身标签上的序列号。</li>
<li><code>Device type</code> 根据实际情况选择 <code>Indoor</code>（室内）或者 <code>Outdoor</code>（室外）。</li>
<li><code>Air Interface</code> 下的 <code>Radio technology</code> 选择 <code>E_UTRA</code>（对应 LTE）。</li>
<li><code>Antenna</code> 下的 <code>Height</code> 一项，填写你的 GPS 海拔高度。</li>
<li><code>Antenna</code> 下的 <code>Height type</code> 一项，选择 <code>AMSL</code>（高度以海平面为参考）。</li>
<li><code>Antenna</code> 下的 <code>Azimuth</code> 一项，输入基站面向的指南针朝向。
<ul>
<li>如果是 FreedomFi/Sercomm 室内基站，由于这款基站的天线是 360 度发射的，方向无关紧要，则可以直接填写 <code>0</code>。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Antenna</code> 下的 <code>Mech downtilt</code> 一项，输入基站向下倾斜的度数，如果没有倾斜可以直接填写 <code>0</code>。</li>
<li><code>Antenna</code> 下的 <code>Horiz accuracy</code> 一项，输入 <code>10</code>。</li>
<li><code>Antenna</code> 下的 <code>Vert accuracy</code> 一项，输入 <code>3</code>。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>你还需要根据基站的数据手册填写以下内容。如果你用的是 FreedomFi/Sercomm 室内基站，可以直接抄我的配置：
<ul>
<li><code>Max EIRP</code> 一项，FreedomFi/Sercomm 室内基站此处填写 <code>29</code>。</li>
<li><code>Antenna</code> 下的 <code>Max gain</code> 一项，FreedomFi/Sercomm 室内基站此处填写 <code>5</code>。</li>
<li><code>Antenna</code> 下的 <code>Beamwidth</code> 一项，FreedomFi/Sercomm 室内基站此处填写 <code>360</code>。</li>
<li><code>Antenna</code> 下的 <code>Azimuth</code> 一项，FreedomFi/Sercomm 室内基站此处填写 <code>360</code>。</li>
<li><code>Measurement capability</code> 下，对于 FreedomFi/Sercomm 室内基站，<code>RX w/ grant</code> 不要打勾，<code>RX w/o grant</code> 需要打勾。</li>
<li><code>Air Interface</code> 下的 <code>Supported spec</code>，FreedomFi/Sercomm 室内基站此处填写 <code>FFS</code>。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>其余配置都可以空着不写，点击 <code>Ready for CPI</code>。</li>
<li>此时页面上会显示「The new configuration must be signed by a CPI before the CBSD registers with the SAS.」（基站再次注册到 SAS 之前，需要认证安装人员 CPI 审批配置）。如果你装的是室内基站，不用管它。但如果你装的是室外基站，就要找一个认证安装人员来审批配置了，或者<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-cbrs-cpi-training" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">自己花 $600 考一个授权安装人员的证</a>。</li>

<p>重启以下基站：把你的基站电源拔掉，等几秒再插上。等几分钟后基站启动完成、GPS 定位完成后，Google SAS 配置页面上应该会出现一些标黄的 <code>Active config value</code>，代表这些配置和你输入的有偏差，不用管它们。</p>
<p>切换到 <code>Status</code> 标签页查看设备状态，应该可以看到基站状态 <code>Authorized</code>，以及对应频段分配了。</p>
<p>此时看一下基站的指示灯，最左侧的 LTE 状态指示灯应该是蓝灯常亮，代表此时已经在发射 LTE 信号。到这里，基站的配置就全部完成了。</p>
<p>拿出你的手机，随便选择一张 SIM 卡，关闭「自动选择网络」选项，手机就会自动搜索附近的移动网络。如果你的手机支持 LTE 48 频段，你应该就能看到一个名为 315010 的网络，这就是你的基站发射的信号。</p>
<h1 id="写-sim-卡">写 SIM 卡</h1>
<p>有了 LTE 网络，下一步就是向 SIM 卡中写入自己网络的认证信息，从而让手机可以连上自己的网络。</p>
<p>我购买可编程 SIM 卡时，商家提供了我这款 SIM 卡适用的 Windows 写卡软件。我试过在 Linux 下使用 pySim 写卡，但是写出来的 SIM 卡无法正常连接网络认证，因此这一步我还是使用 Windows 进行写卡。</p>
<p>把 SIM 卡写卡器插到电脑上，并取出一张可编程 SIM 卡插到写卡器上。</p>
<p>打开写卡软件，先点击右上角的 <code>Read Card</code> 尝试读取卡中的信息，以确保写卡器连接正常。</p>
<p>随后，在右侧 <code>LTE/WCDMA Paramater</code> 中输入如下信息：</p>
<ul>
<li>选择 <code>IMSI15</code>，输入 <code>3150109999XXXXX</code>，其中前十位固定，后五位可以自行编号。
<ul>
<li>前六位 <code>315010</code> 是 CBRS 网络的 MCC/MNC。</li>
<li>接下来的四位 <code>9999</code> 是 CBRS 网络中的 IBN（IMSI 区块编号），<code>9999</code> 是 CBRS 预留的测试编号。完整的 IBN 分配表可以在 <a href="https://imsiadmin.com/assignments/cbrs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CBRS Assignments</a> 网页上查到。</li>
<li>最后五位可以是任意数字编号。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>确保 <code>AD</code> 输入框的值是 <code>00000003</code>。如果这个值不同，点击右侧的编辑按钮，确保 MNC 长度设置为 3。</li>
<li>在 <code>KI</code> 和 <code>OPC</code> 框中各输入一个随机的 32 字符长的 16 进制字符串。这两个字符串是 SIM 卡的认证密钥，一旦写入 SIM 卡中就无法再被读出来。
<ul>
<li>备份好 <code>KI</code> 和 <code>OPC</code>，稍后我们需要把它们输入到 Magma 核心网管理页面上。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>点击 <code>PLMNwAct</code> 右侧的 <code>Auto</code> 按钮，左侧的四个输入框应该会自动填入如图所示的值。</li>
<li>把 <code>SPN</code> 修改成你想要在手机上显示的运营商名，例如 <code>Lan Tian Mobile</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>最后，点击右上角 <code>Write Card</code> 写卡。</p>
<p>如果你想多写几张 SIM 卡，可以如法炮制，但是必须保证所有卡的 <code>IMSI15</code>，<code>KI</code>，<code>OPC</code> 这三个值不同。</p>

<p>使用 Speedtest 进行测速，可以跑到下行 100 Mbps，上行 10 Mbps：</p>

<p>我还试了一个 Android 手机，设备是 Motorola Edge+ 2023。虽然这个手机能搜索到我的 LTE 网络，但无法正常连接，即使是用 iPhone 上试过的 SIM 卡也不行，还需要继续研究。</p>
<h1 id="总结">总结</h1>
<p>我搭建这套 LTE 网络的所有设备及总花费（不计消费税）如下：</p>
<ul>
<li>用来开虚拟机的 Proxmox VE 主机，是我的现有设备 $0</li>
<li>FreedomFi/Sercomm 室内基站设备，设备 $49 + 运费 $12.3 = $61.3</li>
<li>可编程 SIM 卡及写卡器，$38.99</li>
<li>Google SAS $2.64/月，计一个月</li>
<li>总价 $102.93</li>
</ul>
<p>这个价格对于 Homelabber 来说根本不算贵，远低于传统上认为的搭建 LTE 网络需要几百上千刀的花销，并且所有设备和服务都可以简单的买到。</p>]]></content>
